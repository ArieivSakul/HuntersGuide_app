The icicles become its weak spots and can be broken off.\r\n- Velkhana will be extra aggressive when in this form.\r\n- It gains a variety of new ice attacks, such as using moisture in the air to create ice crystals that can fall on hunters, as well as summoning a cluster of ice that expands outward from the original targeted area. \r\n- Its ice beam will create walls of ice that impede your movement.\r\n- Most ice beam and ice breath attacks now also summon clusters of ice that shoot out of the ground along the path of the attack, bursting shortly after, and dealing large damage as well as knocking the hunter back.\r\n \r\n- Tips and notes: \n  - `Iceproof Mantle` can be extremely useful in this fight.\r\n- Velkhana's breath inflicts `Iceblight`, which it will project long range and all around itself when in the air.\r\n- Instead of building up to 20 `Ice resistance` for `Iceblight  `immunity, the `Resuscitate` skill can be used to cancel the effect of Iceblight.\r\n- Keep in mind that its ice beam can not only shoot through its walls of ice, but occasionally the floor\r\n- While in the air, a Slinger Burst will generally knock Velkhana to the ground unless it is enraged.\r\n- While it's covered in its Ice-Armour, the parts of its body covered in ice become weak points, while the rest of its body becomes resistant to attacks.\\\r\n- It will also leave clouds of frost on the floor. These can be used to go into the sliding animation on flat terrain and perform a sliding attack\r\n- Breaking Velkhana's head or tail will sometimes stagger her out of her Ice-covered Form\r\n- When in Velkhana's Ice-covered Form, she will still have a functioning tail to attack with even after severing it off\r\n \r\n- The ice walls formed by Velkhana's attacks can be broken by attacking them \n    - `Torch Pods` can also be used to melt the ice walls\r\n- After being broken/melted, the ice walls will leave behind a small platform of ice that you can climb on top of and jump off to perform aerial attacks\r\n \r\n- Velkhana's sweeping ice beam attack can actually be dodged by jumping off of a small ledge or platform, if timed right. \n    - By timing the jump correctly, the hunter will hop over the ice beam as he jumps off of the ledge/platform.\r\n- The ice platforms left behind by its ice walls after being broken/melted can be used to perform this maneuver. \r\n \r\n \r\n- All things considered, this is probably the hardest mandatory fight of Iceborne. If you saved your Potions and Drugs for the right moment, now is the time to use them.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Velkhana Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Velkhana Low and High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n### Velkhana Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Velkhana Monster.\r\n## \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- It is known as the \"Ice Dragon\" and \"The Iceborne Wyvern\"\r\n- A unique victory theme plays upon defeating Velkhana for the first time.\r\n- It is the flagship monster of Monster Hunter World: Iceborne.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

While Tigrex is turning, try to gain some distance from it and then repeat.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nWhen its slowing down, either run away or get ready to dodge the finisher.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nYou may also `Flash Pod` Tigrex out of the charge, but their effectiveness will decrease with each consecutive use.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nBaiting Tigrex to charge into the ice pillars in the hoarfrost reach or the rock pillars in the Wildspire waste will result in it getting stuck, providing a short damage opportunity.

With its potent tail swipes, sharp claws and pouncing, this foe, while tough, can still be beaten either solo or in a group\r\n\r\nThis fast-moving monster deals both physical damage and elemental damage, shooting out powerful blasts of chilled-wind that can inflict Iceblight.\r\n- It is advisable to focus on breaking its claws, as this will decrease the monster's mobility and leave it open to attacks for a few seconds.\r\n- Like any normal wyvern, Barioth is vulnerable to traps, so preparing your Palico with `Flashfly Cages` can help immensely, along with packing `Pitfall Traps`.\r\n- `Ice Resistance`, `Resuscitate` and `Coldproof` decorations are useful for this fight.\r\n- Hunters should try to stay in close range when fighting this monster, as it has some very long-range attacks. \n  - When it does its huge leaping attack, hunters should try to roll to the left.\r\n \r\n- Your weapon should have white sharpness to take on this monster.\r\n- Kinsect Extracts: \n  - : Head\r\n- : Hindlegs/Body\r\n- : Wings\r\n- : Tail\r\n \r\n- Enraged mode: Eyes will glow red instead of its natural blue. \n  - Barioth enrages after every flash, once he gains his vision back.\r\n- Once his rage wears off, he is really weak, taking long pauses after attacks and not even his ice breath will work.\r\n \r\n- It is recommended that hunters bring `Flash Pods` and `Flashbugs`, to prevent this wyvern from pinning you down as you're healing, sharpening, or buffing.\r\n- `Partbreaker` 3 is good as Barioth's wings and especially the fangs can be very hard to break.\r\n### Barioth Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Barioth Materials\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve/earn the following items:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Barioth Guiding Lands Materials**\r\n\r\nThese materials can only be acquired from hunting Barioth within the `Guiding Lands`. \r\n###  \r\n###  Barioth Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nPictured below are the available weapons that can be crafted from this specific wyvern's materials.\r\n## \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- Debut appearance in Monster Hunter 3.\r\n- It is known as the \"Ice Tusk Wyvern\".\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Sparks its tail to light and inflicts `Fireblight`. (Firecharges are independent of enrage mode)\r\n- You can obtain shiny drops by causing its firecharged throat to explode, after either dealing enough damage or well aimed slinger shot (`Puddle Pod` is very effective)\r\n- Tenderizing the hindlegs is very effective since its head and tail are very high up and might be difficult for some weapons to attack.\r\n- Its back is riddled with breakable spots, making attacks from above very effective.\r\n- Be cautious when its throat starts to glow, it will start blasting fireballs. They stick to the floor, causing `Fire` damage in the area around them, and explode after a moment.\r\n- Be aware that its throat and head are separate hitzones, but attacking either will cause firecharged throat threshold damage\r\n- `Shock Traps` work well against it if you want to attack it's tail, if you would rather attack it's throat easily, `Pitfall Traps` are very effective\r\n- `Fireproof Mantle` can be extremely useful to reduce `Fire` damage and make you immune to `Fireblight`\r\n- Damaging its throat while it is glowing will cause it to fall to the ground over his back.\r\n- Be especially weary whenever it puts its tail in its mouth. It is an opportunity for damage but he might do a very high damage rotating attack. \n  - This devastating attack takes about three seconds to charge. If your main weapon is a weapon with a counterattack ability, (The `Longsword` for example) take advantage of the free damage opportunity, count three seconds, then perform the counterattack.\r\n \r\n- Severing the tail: Glavenus' tail has a mechanic which stops damage going to the tail sever threshold when its tail is not flaming. This would make its tailtip only severable while it is flaming because that is the only time the threshold can take damage. The `Lance's` Claw counter is very effective, as you can take an easy hit whenever it attacks you with its tail. \\\r\nYou can chip the tail however, by hitting tailbase with any type of damage, even when its not flaming. Its separate part from severable tailtip, with its own hitzone and breaking treshold.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Glavenus Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Glavenus Low and High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n### Glavenus Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Glavenus Monster.\r\n## \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- Can be lured with ??\r\n- Camouflage works until ?? range\r\n- It is known as the \"Cutting Wyvern\"\r\n- Its battle music theme is \"The Scorching Blade\"\r\n- The inspiration of Glavenus's design was the \"Land counterpart of `Rathalos`.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Whiskers also glow blue.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nThe monster mainly sprays water, which applies `Waterblight`. These streams of water also leave behind puddles, which enhance Namielle’s movement and attacks. Namielle can fire a thin beam at these puddles, causing them to explode, or create large waves with a sweep of its wings. Namielle can also absorb these puddles to recharge its reserves.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nNamielle will charge up lightning, which can be seen arcing in its wings and body. Namielle can enhance its physical attacks with this electricity, or fly up and store the electricity in its tentacle-like wing tips, striking the ground as it flies overhead. This flight attack can easily apply `Thunderblight` if it should hit. Any puddles hit with this electricity will vaporize, dealing extra damage if a hunter is in contact, but causing the puddle to disappear. Connected puddles can arc electricity for a short distance.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nWill let out a distinct roar and leap upwards, its center surging with glowing electricity. It will then slam into the ground, causing a “supernova” effect. A small arc of lightning will deal a bit of damage, then a massive shockwave will cause every puddle in the area to explode. Namielle will then leave, drained of all water and scales a beige color. This attack is one of the fastest “elder specials”, and can easily take out a hunter. The dive move should be dodged, as areas such as the nest can be completely filled with puddles, making normal dodging ineffective. The total animation from roar to hit takes about four seconds.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Arch-Tempered version of the Namielle monster can be extremely deadly. It's best for hunters to prioritize Range, and use the `Canteen` to get `Felyne Insurance` skill.\r\n\r\nSpecial rewards: `Arch-Tempered Namielle Pendant`, `Namielle Ticket` - used to craft `Namielle Gamma + Armor Set`\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n-  \r\nSignificant damage boost. Your defense should be above 1000 at this point, and most attacks still take around 70 health.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nNow leaves water puddles underneath it as long as Namielle is coated in Water.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nEnrages easier (Like most tempered monsters). Every Slinger Burst needs to hit its target, because Namielle will enrage after every single one.\r\n \r\n- Very Frequent use of the \"Supernova\" Move.\r\n- Will now sleep in the middle of area 10 when near-death, preventing any wake-up flinch shots.\r\n\r\nSome tips for hunters:\r\n-  \r\nRanged weapons work best\r\n \r\n-  \r\nExtremely difficult without `Health Boost` 3\r\n \r\n-  \r\n`Vitality Mantle` and `Temporal Mantle` are very useful.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n`Lifepowders` and such are very useful if you intend to do it as a group.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nNamielle is weakest to `Fire` and `Blast`\r\n \r\n-  \r\nUse `Brightmoss` to drain the puddles around the area\r\n \r\n-  \r\nIf your mantles are down and she is \"electric\" beware of OHKO from her slam\r\n \r\n-  \r\nPatience! Slow and steady wins the quest\r\n \r\n-  \r\nIf you notice the camera zooming out, DROP EVERYTHING AND START RUNNING. That's the Supernova and its almost guaranteed a oneshot if you're caught in it.\r\n-  \r\nThe Supernova consists of two hits, one shock through all the puddles and a second one that makes all the puddles explode with a slighty larger blast radius.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nCombined they can do serious damage through the bulkiest defense\r\n \r\n-  \r\nBest avoided by diving right before Namielle hits the ground.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nIf you dodge it by standing outside the puddles, the Second hit may still hit you if you're standing too close.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Namielle Weaknesses\r\n### Namielle Low and High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n### Namielle Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Namielle Monster.\r\n## \r\n## \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- It is known as the \"Abyss Dragon\".\r\n- Moss can be used to soak up Namielle’s water spots. However, since Namielle uses so many water attacks, it is not recommended to focus on absorbing these spots. Rather, in tight areas, use the moss to create safe spaces from Namielle’s devastating “nova” attack.\r\n\r\n \r\n"

        "mainContent": "\r\n**Shara Ishvalda** is a `Large Monster` in **Monster Hunter World (MHW)**. アン・イシュワルダ (地啼龍) in Japanese. It was added with the `Iceborne Expansion` on Sept. 6th, 2019 and acts as its final boss.\r\n### Shara Ishvalda Details & Locations\r\n- Found in: `Origin Isle`\r\n- Target of Quests: `Paean of Guidance`, after completion, optional quest `Faraway Lorelei` appears randomly for 2 quests. Special Event Quest `The Naked Truth`.\r\n- Is hostile when approached.\r\n- Size: 2910.91 ~ 2910.91\r\n- Species: `Elder Dragons`\r\n- HP: ~37630(Solo), ~63,388(Duo), ~94,605(3 or 4 players)\r\n\r\n \r\n### Shara Ishvalda Combat Info\r\n- Kinsect Extracts: \n  - : Head/Wings\r\n- : Torso/Tail \r\n- : Legs \r\n \r\n- Both stages can be mounted.\r\n- You can use your `Clutch Claw` to latch onto its head and knock it into the rocks traps(trap icons on mini map) to deal massive damage.\r\n- After it is freed, avoid being in front of it, and make good use of your `Temporal Mantle`, `Health Booster` or `Vitality Mantle`.\r\n- Bring `Lifepowder` or use the skill `Wide-Range` so you might heal your allies.\r\n- `Stun Resistance` is helpful during this fight.\r\n- You can obtain Shiny Drops by attacking and breaking its legs, head and chest.\r\n- Hunters must begin by stripping its sturdy rock armor: bombs and falling rocks are two proven methods. Skills to counter tremors are a boon against its wingtip attacks.\r\n- Armored form: Very slow, but immensely strong. \n  - Be careful when standing underneath it, as it will occasionally jump to crush any hunters underfoot.\r\n- It will swipe at hunters with its wings, or use them as clubs to pound the ground.\r\n- It will sometimes burrow its body underground, exposing only its back, head, and wings. When this happens everyone should stay directly in front of it's face which is 90% safe from all its attacks in this mode.\r\n- It will also rake its wingtips from one side of the arena to the other, for 1 to 3 times. If you are up close attacking, and it starts to move backwards, it is about to use the \"plow\" move.\r\n- It can also create pools of sand around itself with its wingtips.\r\n \r\n- Unarmored form: Faster, and heavily relies on using its wings to attack with vibrated air. \n  - It will continue to use its wings as melee weapons, along with the occasional bite.\r\n- It can shoot a single beam of air at a time, or multiple using all of its wingtips.\r\n- It can shoot a massive beam of air by centering its wingtips in front of its face.\r\n- Occasionally, it will burrow to the edge of the arena, create a large sphere of air, then launch it towards the center of the arena as a wide-scale AOE attack.\r\n- The pools of sand it creates resonate with it's sound/air attacks and explode after one of them touches it.\\\r\n\\\r\n\r\n \r\n### Easy Hunt\r\n- Make sure to eat at the canteen before going into this quest or `Farcaster` to do so.\r\n- For Shara Ishvalda's rock form, make sure to wall slam it twice into the falling wall trap. This can be easily set up by standing by it to lure Shara to it. You can also trigger the trap using bombs.\r\n- When Shara Ishvalda sheds its rock armor, you can stay on its rear, using clutch claw to weaken it. Just keep attacking the rear portion of its body and you should be very safe.\r\n- In the rockless state there will be 3 wall traps to slam Shara Ishvalda into, but if Shara Ishvalda triggers them (shoots with air) they will not deal damage to it. Again you can trigger these traps using bombs but make sure Shara is close enough.\r\n### Going for the Scalp\r\n- You need two Shara Ishvalda Tenderplates (and one gem) for every Shara-Ishvalda weapon, which are good for mid-tier Master Rank. Obtaining the Tenderplate can be difficult as it can't be carved from its corpse\r\n- Shara Ishvalda's head can be broken twice to get the Scalp to drop. Carving the Scalp will give you two Tenderplate\r\n- To avoid killing Shara Ishvalda before you get the Scalp to drop,you need to go for the head as much as possible\\\r\n- `Partbreaker` 3 is a must have, as it will decrease the overall damage you need to deal to the head\r\n- A `Great Sword` is a very good choice, as it has a long reach, high damage and a hidden `Partbreaker` bonus on the Charged Slashes. The `Beo Slasher II` is a good choice, as it will deal decent damage without charms or gems and is relatively easy to craft.\r\n \r\n- In Phase two (Closed Eyes), go for the head exclusively. If done right, you can get the scalp before phase three starts. \n  - Tenderize the head as soon as possible with a grappled attack. Keep it tenderized at all times.\r\n- Shara Ishvalda leaves its head usually open after every attack. Put priority on avoiding its attacks by sprinting and go for draw attacks on the head. Avoid hitting anything else.\r\n- Some of its attacks will leave Shara Ishvalda's head unprotected for longer, letting you get a Strong Charge Slash in. Don't go for a True Charge Slash or Shara Ishvalda will hit you.\r\n- Using the slinger burst to slam Shara Ishvalda into a wall will count as damage to the head.\r\n \r\n- If Phase three (Eyes open) starts and you haven't broken the Head twice yet, go for the Front legs. \n  - Breaking either one of the front legs will knock Shara Ishvalda down long enough to get a True Charge Slash on its head. Use this to finally break the scalp off.\r\n \r\n- Aiming to break Shara Ishvalda's head can result in a very drawn out fight. \n  - Three pieces of `Tigrex Armor` allow you to stack three Free Meals, greatly increasing your healing supplies.\r\n- Carry a `Farcaster` to return to your camp if you ever run low on supplies.\r\n- Bring `Dash Juice`, as you will do a lot of sprinting.\r\n- `Health Boost` 3 is pretty good considering Shara Ishvalda's extreme damage output can easily twoshot you without it.\r\n- As soon as the scalp breaks, your first priority should be to carve it. Beam attacks are a great opportunity to go in for the carve.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Shara Ishvalda Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Shara Ishvalda Low and High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n### Shara Ishvalda Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Shara Ishvalda Monster. **These are unconfirmed and pre-release information for now!**\r\n## \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- It is known as the \"Earth Singing Dragon\" or \"Old Everwyrm\".\r\n- It is the first large monster to have the \"Switch Display\" option in its Hunter's Notes entry. \n  - It is the first monster to have an alternate form for its Physiology and Rewards pages.\r\n \r\n- When its eyes open, they track the camera instead of the hunter. The reason for this, as theorised by fans, is that Shara stares directly into the soul of a hunter, which is actually the player controlling the hunter, making this a fourth wall break. Also, when fighting it in multiplayer, every player perceives the eyes tracking them, disregarding anyone else.\r\n- Despite the Hunter's Notes not marking the wings as breakable in its unarmored form, they still are breakable; they're just harder to hit properly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n"

It is a variant of `Deviljho`.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Savage Deviljho Details & Locations\r\n- Found in: All Biomes\r\n- Target of Quests: `A Reason behind the Hunger` (Event quest).\r\n- Is hostile on sight.\r\n- Has Turf Wars with: `Diablos`, `Black Diablos`, `Legiana`, `Shrieking Legiana`, `Rathalos`, `Azure Rathalos`, `Seething Bazelgeuse`, `Namielle`, `Ruiner Nergigante`, `Rajang`, `Blackveil Vaal Hazak`, `Velkhana`\r\n- Size:  ~ \r\n- Species: `Brute Wyvern`\r\n- Is immune to `Dung Pods` when enraged\r\n- HP: ~23,040(Solo), ~39,348(Duo), ~58,752(3 or 4 players)\r\n###  Avoiding Savage Deviljho\r\n-  \r\nFighting Savage Deviljho is in no way required to beat Iceborne. However, Savage Deviljho likes to show up uninvited.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nLike his regular counterpart, Savage Deviljho can be encountered on every map that isn't a dedicated Boss arena.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nSavage Deviljho invades `Elder Dragons` quests, even assigned ones. The longer the hunter spends fighting the Elder Dragon, the higher the Chance of Deviljho showing up. It will spawn close to the Elder Dragon and immediately go for a Turf War. Afterwards, it will  either leave or go for the hunter instead.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nMost `Investigations` with good rewards and large time limits have a Savage Deviljho waiting in them.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nSavage Deviljho will usually approach the hunter at least once if they are on the same map. To lose them, Flash Savage Deviljho, then run away. Never get between a Savage Deviljho and its prey. Use the interactions with other Monsters to scram and wait until your target and Savage Deviljho separate.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Utilizing Savage Deviljho\r\n-  \r\nThere are few monsters that can stand up to a Savage Deviljho, limited to most Elder Dragons (except for Kirin), Rajang (and potentially Furious Rajang) and Seething Bazelgeuse. All other monsters are mostly defenseless against Savage Deviljho. The hunter may choose to use this to their advantage by deliberately luring a Savage Deviljho to an unsuspecting target.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nThe `Challenger Mantle` will help the hunter to keep Savage Deviljhos, on the contrary, the `Ghillie Mantle` will make losing Savage Deviljo significantly easier.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nSavage Deviljho will consistently slam other monsters for 500 damage that the player can see because it is considered environmental damage like `Blast` (other attacks will still deal damage, but no damage numbers will show up).\r\n \r\n-  \r\nIf the hunter wants to capitalize on this, they should watch out to not stand between Savage Deviljho and its prey, to not get caught in the crossfire.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nSavage Deviljho is especially effective against `Fanged Wyverns` and `Bird Wyverns`, as Savage Deviljho will effortlessly pick them up with its mouth. Its target has no chance of fighting back and will repeatedly get slammed into walls and dragged accross the floor for very high damage. This lasts for quite a while untlil Savage Deviljho's prey is finally released and runs away. This interaction somewhat counts as a Turf War and has a cooldown period.\r\n \r\n### Savage Deviljho Combat Info\r\n- Kinsect Extracts: \n  - : Head/Tail\r\n- : Torso/Back\r\n- : Legs\r\n \r\n-  \r\nEnraged mode: Muscles expand and bulge out of its body, making Savage Deviljho deal more damage but also receive more damage. Attacks faster. Uses its Dragonbreath more often.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nUnlike regular `Deviljho`, Savage Deviljho inflicts `Defense Down` with every other attack, which can be countered by `Iron Skin`.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nSavage Deviljho also likes to coat half of an Area in `Dragon` Element clouds, so having the Dragonproof Mantle equipped will help.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nSavage Deviljho enrages easily and stays enraged for large periods of time.

The pressure from this explosion can knock the player back if they are too close to the epicenter, as well as getting hit by one of the spore pods (which can also stun the player). These spore pods will then explode, creating a thick fog in a large circle for 60s and will cause significant damage to players within it.

However, punching or Slinger-bursting the Arms will have the same effect.\r\n- Rajang has no moves that directly target someone behind him. Standing at Rajang's rear end will be relatively safe. However, Rajang can turn or jump at any moment, so be on guard.\r\n- If the hunter spends to much time clutch clawed onto Rajang, It will react with a special grab move that leads to a pin.\r\n- You can interrupt Rajang's rampage mode (recognizable by its glowing red arms) by damaging its tail. You don't need to break it, just damage it.\r\n- Traps will become less and less effective with every use. Also, Rajang can still attack out of a `Pitfall Trap`.\r\n- Rajang will annihilate most other monsters in a turf war.

        "mainContent": "\r\n**Safi'jiiva** is a `Large Monster` in **Monster Hunter World (MHW)**. ムフェト・ジーヴァ (Mufeto jīvu~a) in Japanese. It is the adult form of `Xeno'jiiva`, and can only be fought in Master Rank.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Safi'jiiva Details & Locations\r\n- Found in: Secluded Valley\r\n- Target of Quests: `Point of No Return` (Safi'jiiva Recon), `The Red Dragon` (`Safi'jiiva Siege`, only available online)\r\n- Is hostile when approached\r\n- Size: This monster's size does not vary and is always 4799.78.\r\n- Species: `Elder Dragons`\r\n- HP: 20,000(Solo), 26, 000(Duo) 40,000(3 or 4 players)(Safi regenerates HP everytime it absorbs energy from the ground) \n  - Head: 26,250\r\n- Back: 525\r\n- Chest: 7,000\r\n- Forelegs: 18,375 each\r\n- Hindlegs: 8,750 each\r\n- Wings: 4,200 each\r\n- Tail: 19,250\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Safi'jiiva Combat Info\r\n\r\n**General Info:**\r\n- Kinsect Extracts: \n  - : Head/Neck/Chest\r\n- : Body/Hindlegs\r\n- : Wings/Frontlegs\r\n- : Tail\r\n \r\n- Safi'jiiva's attacks are mostly elementless, even the beams. The only elemental attacks are the flame left on the ground after Safi'jiiva uses its thinner beams, which also causes `Fireblight`. Investing in `Fire Resistance` is thus not as useful as in the fights with monsters directly dealing fire attacks, such as `Kulve Taroth`.\r\n-  \r\nSafi'jiiva's limbs will always tenderize after one `Clutch Claw` weapon attack, no matter the weapon used even if you're not using `Clutch Claw Boost`.\r\n \r\n- Fixed damage types (barrel bombs, sticky ammos, Gunlance shells, Charge Blade impact phials) deal 30% less damage on any part that isn't already broken.\r\n- Poison and Blast both deal extra damage to Safi'jiiva. However, Poison doesn't contribute to part breaking. Hunters can bring `Poison Smoke Bombs` to inflict Poison on Safi'jiiva and save their weapons for part-breaking purposes. In a 4-player difficulty, the 1st poison needs 3 bombs, and the 2nd poison needs 5 bombs.\r\n\r\n**Phase 1:**\r\n- Safi'jiiva will not change position (but can turn around) on his own. It can only be pushed by the hunters dealing enough damage on specific parts to flinch it. The direction it moves is opposite to the relative direction of that specific part to its main body (e.g., attacking the head can push it backward). \r\n- Flinching Safi'jiiva when it's on the vine area will get it stuck in the vine trap.\r\n- There are two boulder traps that can be dropped on Safi'jiiva in this area, one on each side of the map. The handler will notify you if Safi'jiiva is at a good position for you to drop the boulders. Alternatively, you can judge it by yourself.\r\n- Triggering the falling boulders or the vine trap will result in Safi'jiiva absorbing the energy of this area. The only exception is when the boulder is dropped on it when Safi'jiiva is in an uninterruptable animation.\r\n-  \r\nTriggering any two environmental traps will cause Safi'jiiva to fully drain energy and leave to the next area.\r\n \r\n- A useful way to trigger two environmental traps back-to-back is to push Safi'jiiva to the vine areas close to the boulder on the left-hand side (when you face the cliff), flinch it to trigger the vine trap, and drop the boulder onto its wing when it's just about to leave the vine trap. This strategy can significantly shorten the time of phase 1 and potentially get one wing break by the boulder drop, thus is often used in speed runs. Note that using slinger ammos to drop the boulder might result in hitting Safi'jiiva's wing, so using penetrating ammos like elemental ammos might be a better option.\r\n\r\n**Phase 2:**\r\n- Safi'jiiva can now move around. \r\n- There are many ledges in this area. Hunters can use them to perform certain attacks or to mount Safi'jiiva.\r\n- Starting from this phase, Safi'jiiva will start giving enmity to the player who deals the most damage in the previous moments. A red line connects its head with the targeted player. The player who gains enmity will be the target of all Safi'jiiva attacks. Safi will be in enraged state for as long as enmity is active.\r\n- The targeted hunter failing to maintain enmity (e.g., by carting, forecasting, smoke hiding or not dealing enough damage continuously) will result in Safi'jiiva losing its attention and attacking the team more . When it finds a new target, it often performs the supernova before giving enmity to the new targeted hunter.\r\n-  \r\nDealing enough damage to Safi will result him in performing his supernova called Sapphire of the Emperor. Hunters can hide behind one of the crags in the area to avoid taking this instant-kill attack. It can be interrupted when Safi'jiiva hasn't reached the highest point, by flash pods (note that there exists a cool-down time after every two pods) or any means to flinch Safi'jiiva. See further below for more information about the nova.\r\n \r\n\r\n**Phase 3:**\r\n- There are climbable cliffs for the hunters to perform jumping attack and mount Safi'jiiva. But these cliffs disappear after Safi'jiiva performs its first supernova.\r\n-  \r\nSafi'jiiva will now periodically enter the Supercritical State. In this state, all body parts become much more susceptible to damage, and the chest can now be hit and broken.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nIt is recommended to keep all crowd control (mount, paralysis, sleep) for the Supercritical state, as this is when Safi'jiiva is both the most vulnerable and the most dangerous. Keep in mind however that you cannot kill Safi'jiiva until it fully drained the energy of this area.\r\n \r\n- In the end of each Supercritical state period, Safi'jiiva performs its supernova and returns to the normal state. However, using a flash pod to interrupt it just before the supernova can make it keep the Supercritical state afterwards.\r\n- After the first supernova, the gas traps in this area will be revealed. Hunters can attack the gas to explode it when any part of Safi'jiiva is on these regions. The gas explosion deals fixed damage on Safi'jiiva. One gas explosion can flinch Safi'jiiva, and the next one can knock it down, if these explosions happen when Safi'jiiva is NOT in an uninterruptable animation (e.g., the resting animation after a supernova). It's better to save the gas knockdown for the Supercritical state to do more damage.\r\n- The benefit of pursuing the gas trap is however debatable. Safi'jiiva can be lured to the gas traps by the targeted hunter, but if that hunter runs directly toward the gas trap, the other hunters might lose the chance to do damage because Safi'jiiva leaves them swiftly. Also, if the targeted hunter moves too far from Safi'jiiva, the enmity might be lost. It's thus suggested for the targeted hunter to lure Safi'jiiva slowly while keeping attacking it. \r\n- When Safi'jiiva is about to die, it drops some `Bomb Pods`. They can be used to flinch Safi'jiiva, especially to save the group from a full-party wipe (see a section below). But note that the effects of pods have their cool-down time.\r\n- While the official time limit of the siege quest is 20 min, Safi'jiiva escapes at ~19:50 if not interrupted. If interrupted, the quest will end at 20 min anyway.\r\n### Attacks to Look Out For\r\n-  \r\n**Ring Explosions: **Safi'jiiva will sink its forelegs into the ground, very similar to `Xeno'jiiva`, creating a massive explosion around him. This time however, the explosion spreads to 4 rings. The hunters can roll inward after an inner ring explodes, or dive evade when a ring is about to explode.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Dual Beam Attack: **Safi'jiiva will shoot a beam at one hunter. The beam will simply knock down the hunter for a short time and deal low damage. However, it is followed by a much more devastating beam attack shortly after the hunter gets back up. The hunter should immediately roll away since the second beam doesn't track.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Charged Beam**: Safi'jiiva will open his mouth to charge a beam attack, indicated by a blue glow. While Safi'jiiva is charging, he will track the movement of its target. When its mouth glows white light, the tracking stops and Safi'jiiva is about to emit the beam. To dodge this attack, the targeted hunter can first stay at a place and then roll out when seeing the white glow.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Deadly Pin: **Safi'jiiva will lunge at a hunter with his head lowered. If the head touches any hunter, the hunter will be pinned. Safi'jiiva then proceeds to grab the hunter with his mouth, following up with several beam attacks. The final attack will leave the hunter at exactly 1 HP and burning. As teammates, make sure to use `Dust of Life` or  `Lifepowder` to help the attacked hunter after the final beam, or the hunter will die to `Fireblight`. The grab can also be interrupted with a well aimed `Flash Pod`. The signal of Safi'jiiva about to perform this move is easy to recognize. To dodge this move, it's usually better to roll to the left side.\r\n \r\n### Siege Rewards\r\n- The siege rewards can be obtained at the gathering hub quest counter after completion of a Safi'jiiva siege.\r\n- The rewards include two boxes, (1) the materials called Dracolites, used to upgrade (`Awaken`) `Safi'jiiva weapons` in the workshop, and (2) Safi'jiiva weapons.\r\n- The quantities of both Dracolites and weapons, as well as the qualities of Dracolites, increase with the reward level. The reward level progresses from level 1 to a maximum of level 17. It's increased by the reward points hunters obtain through achieving certain objectives in the siege: \n  - Single Run Siege Completed: 2 Gold Rewards (higher quality Dracolites)\r\n- Safi'jiiva Slayed: 500 Pts\r\n- Super-critical State Reached: 30 Pts\r\n- 2nd Level Reached: 15 Pts\r\n- Bottom Level Reached: 20 Pts\r\n- 1st Level Energy Absorbed: 15 Pts\r\n- 2nd Level Energy Absorbed: 20 Pts\r\n- Bottom Level Energy Absorbed: 25 Pts\r\n- 1st Level Energy Depleted: 80 Pts\r\n- 2nd Level Energy Depleted: 100 Pts\r\n- Bottom Level Energy: 120 Pts\r\n- Back Broken: 100 Pts\r\n- Chest Broken: 200 Pts\r\n- Right Wing Broken: 50 Pts\r\n- Left Wing Broken: 50 Pts\r\n- Right Hind-leg Broken: 20 Pts\r\n- Left Hind-leg Broken: 20 Pts\r\n- Right Foreleg Broken: 20 Pts\r\n- Left Foreleg Broken: 20 Pts\r\n- Tail Severed: 120 Pts\r\n- Head Partly Broken: 20 Pts\r\n- Head Completely Broken: 180 Pts\r\n \r\n- \"Single Run Siege Completed\" means that you successfully kill Safi'jiiva in a siege you have attended since full energy. It doesn't need to be a one-turn kill.\r\n- Messages will pop up during the hunt when an objective is achieved.\r\n- Completing an objective more than one time in a siege does not give extra reward points. To maximize the rewards, you want to break as many parts of Safi'jiiva's body as possible. Once a part is broken, make sure to move to the next one. \r\n- Completion of an objective by another group in the session gives you part (normally half) of the reward points if your group hasn't finished that objective yet.\r\n-  \r\nA Safi'jiiva siege is completed when any group in the same session has slayed Safi'jiiva. Although another group slaying it grants 400 pts out of the 500 pts to your group, you might miss the \"Single Run Siege Completed\" objective if you don't slay it in that run. Therefore, it might be better to focus on slaying Safi'jiiva if you see the message of another group having slayed it when your time is enough but tight.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nWhile you can take all the Dracolites you earn in a siege, you can only choose certain number of weapons in the reward weapon box. The maximum is 4 weapons and is reached at reward level 13.\r\n \r\n- When obtaining the rewards from the quest counter, equip yourself with the weapon type you're farming for, since the last two weapons in the reward box are always the same type as what you are equipped with then.\r\n-  \r\nThe highest reward level that can be obtained in a one-turn kill (starting from full energy) is 15. This can be obtained by breaking all parts except one of the four legs.\r\n \r\n### Strategies for Part Breaking\r\n\r\nPart breaking is the most important part in a Safi'jiiva siege because it increases the reward level. However, different parts are weak to different types of damages, as listed in detail in a section below. Here, strategies for breaking certain parts are introduced.\r\n\r\n**General tips:**\r\n- Get Partbreaker skill level 3.\r\n- Always try to tenderize a part before attacking it. This increases the damage a lot.\r\n- Don't pursue breaking the same part twice. It doesn't give extra points.\r\n- Prioritize the chest in the Supercritical state. It gives the highest points.\r\n- De-prioritize the legs. They give the lowest points.\r\n- Be familiar with 2-3 types of weapons, since different parts have different weaknesses.\r\n\r\n**Head:**\r\n- The head is weak to blunt weapons.\r\n- The head can be broken twice. The \"partly\" break gives 20 points, and the \"complete\" break gives 180 points. Be sure to go for the complete break if you're targeting the head.\r\n- The head becomes weaker when partly broken. For example, for ammos it's a weak spot when partly broken, making spread ammos an effective way to break it completely.\r\n- The snout (front part of the head) is resilient to ranged attacks.\r\n- The head is fast moving and can damage hunters badly, thus more difficult for slower or shorter reaching melee weapons.\r\n- To enable all the group members to reach the head, knocking down Safi'jiiva by the boulders in phase 1, stunning it by blunt weapons such as Hammers or sticky ammos, and mounting it using IG or `Glider Mantle` are all effective ways to create a long opening. Once Safi'jiiva is down, all the members in the group should try to break the head, unless it's in the Supercritical state and they are going for the chest.\r\n- For blunt melee weapon users, the head should be their first focus in a siege, unless they are not confident in dealing with it (then go for the hinderlegs).\r\n\r\n**Back:**\r\n- The back is weak to melee attacks.\r\n- The back's location is roughly the protruding hill between the two wings, but slightly closer to the head.\r\n- Ironically, the back is not reachable to most melee weapons most of the time, even when Safi'jiiva is knocked down. One effective way of breaking it is thus the attacks during a mount. If the back is not broken, try to prioritize attacking it when you mount Safi'jiiva.\r\n- An alternative strategy for melee users to break the back is to sleep Safi'jiiva and put barrel bombs for the awakening attack. However, sleeping is better saved for more important purposes, such as head or chest breaking or saving the group from a full-party wipe (see a section below), if back breaking is not an issue for the group.\r\n- For gunners, the back is much more reachable, but ironically very resilient to ammo attacks. The exception is explosive damages like sticky ammos, which neglects the part's weakness. One useful strategy for sticky gunners is to stun Safi'jiiva by attacking its head, and then shoot the back. The back's hp is very low and should be broken with 5-10 shots of sticky ammo 3.\r\n\r\n**Wings:**\r\n- The wings are weak to ranged attacks.\r\n- The V-shape thick red parts of the wings are much weaker to ammos than the white membrane. Even when taking the same damage number (e.g., by sticky ammos), they seem to have a higher part-breaking multiplier (roughly +20%) than the membrane. However, they are also much harder to aim.\r\n- Sticky ammos are an easy (but not the most efficient) way for gunners to break the wings if consistently aiming at the red parts is not easy for them. Although they are generally lower in damage than the other types of ammos, their ability to neglect parts' weakness means that the gunners don't necessarily have to aim at the red parts of the wings.\r\n- An alternative way for melee users to break the wings is to explode barrel bombs on the red parts when Safi'jiiva is knocked down. However, the chance of knocking down Safi'jiiva is limited, and it might not fall to the side of the wing you want to break.\r\n- For ranged weapon users, the wings should be their first focus in a siege, since the red parts are easier to aim at in phase 1.\r\n\r\n**Tail:**\r\n- The tail is ONLY breakable (cuttable) by severing weapons.\r\n- If not in the Supercritical state, the hitzone value of the tail is below 27 for severing weapons. Therefore, the skill `Weakness Exploit` cannot be triggered, no matter the tail is tenderized or not. The severing weapon users should increase the infinity by other means.\r\n- The tail can sweep across long distances very easily, its attacks often come with ground explosion or wind pressure, and the position where hunters stand to attack the tail is often within the hinderlegs' attack range. Therefore, doing constant damage to the tail is not an easy task. The hunters can use `Rocksteady Mantle` to avoid being interrupted, and use far-reaching weapons like LS or GS to catch up with the tail's fast moves.\r\n- When any hunters are attacking the tail, Safi'jiiva tends to focus on attacking them (if it's not targeting a specific hunter). Even worse, when the hunter being targeted by Safi'jiiva (having enmity in phase 2 or 3) is attacking the tail, Safi'jiiva tends to turn around to face that hunter, making hitting the tail an annoying chasing game. The group can try to shift Safi'jiiva's attention by clutch claw flinch shots, or the targeted hunter can smoke hide to lose enmity. However, this can sometimes lead to Safi'jiiva using its supernova attack.\r\n- For severing melee weapon users, the tail should be their first focus in a siege, unless they cannot attack it consistently (then go for the forelegs), or they are confident in dealing with the head.\r\n\r\n**Chest:**\r\n- The chest is weak to every kind of damage in the Supercritical state, but only in this state. Any damage dealt out of this state does absolutely nothing on breaking it.\r\n- The chest is the most valuable part to break since it gives the highest reward point. Therefore, all the players should prioritize attacking it during the Supercritical state if it's reachable to their weapons.\r\n- The location of the chest is roughly the protruding part under its main body, next to the neck. However, the exact location seems to be deep under the skin and might change its relative position to the skin features when Safi'jiiva changes its pose.\r\n- When Safi'jiiva is standing, the chest is only reachable to high reaching weapons most of the time. GS, CB using the SAED attack, bows, and gunners using spread ammos are good choices to target it. However, even for these weapons, aiming at the chest needs some practice. One can tell if a damage is NOT landed on the chest by a grey damage number (since the chest is a weak spot) or by the 4 ' symbols around the damage number (since the chest cannot be tenderized).\r\n- The more practical way of attacking the chest is, however, trying to knock down Safi'jiiva (stun, mount, sleep or use the gas trap) or paralyze it. When Safi'jiiva is down in the Supercritical state, all players should prioritize breaking it.\r\n- Note that Safi'jiiva will be knocked down when certain amount of damage has been dealt on the chest. This knockdown gives a nice opening for the hunters to break its chest.\r\n\r\n**Legs:**\r\n- The forelegs are weak to severing attacks, and the hinderlegs are weak to blunt attacks.\r\n- Breaking the legs gives the lowest reward points among all parts, and their hp are very high. Hence, the hunters should NOT prioritize breaking them until all the other parts are broken.\r\n- The legs are the easiest part to do high damage to Safi'jiiva itself. If you are going for energy drain or slaying Safi'jiiva, these are the parts to focus on.\r\n- Using elemental ammos is an effective way to attack legs due to their fast speed and ability to hit two legs in one shot. A popular way to deal high damage on the legs (and Safi'jiiva itself) is using `Water Ammo` with `Safi's Aquashot` LBG, since it can deal high damage and crowd control (paralysis and sleep) Safi'jiiva. For elemental ammo users, tenderizing parts and increasing affinities are not necessary since the elemental part of the damage does not increase in critical hits, unless `Critical Element` or `True Critical Element` is equipped.\r\n### Safi'jiiva Energy Management\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Safi'jiiva's energy mechanic is the key to significantly speed up the Safi'jiiva hunt (which is necessary in a single-run kill since you only have 20 minutes).\r\n-  \r\nSafi'Jiiva has exactly 40000 health and an energy deposit of 10000 Units (EU for short)\r\n \r\n-  \r\nEvery time Safi'jiiva's HP drop below a certain amount or his energy reserves significantly decrease, he will absorb energy out of the area he's currently in, restoring his HP and refilling his energy reserve.\r\n-  \r\nIn Area 1, Safi'jiiva will drain if his HP drop below 70% and will heal to full\r\n \r\n-  \r\nIn Area 2, Safi'jiiva will drain if his HP drop below 50% and will heal to full after the Supernova\r\n \r\n-  \r\nIn Area 3, Safi'jiiva will drain if his HP drop below 40% and will restore 35% of his HP\r\n \r\n \r\n-  \r\nWith every drain, all parts will heal up to 50% of their current flinch threshold. Broken parts stay unbroken.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nEvery area has an energy storage of exactly 10000 at the start of the siege, however energy is drained twice as fast in the last two areas.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nSafi'jiiva will only move to the next area after he has absorbed all the energy in the current area. Every time Safi'jiiva does that, he will restore 15% of its health regardless of energy reserves.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nForcing Safi'jiiva to lose large amounts of energy will speed up the fight significantly. Several things will help with this.\r\n \r\n###  Avoiding the Full Party Wipe\r\n\r\nIn the last area of the Siege, Safi'jiiva will perform the Sapphire Star of the Emperor attack (Supernova) fairly regularly. To avoid a full party wipe, the hunters need to hide behind rocks/crags.\r\n- The crags break after every Supernova. Two attacks will generate new ones.\r\n- The first is the Attack where Safi'jiiva shoots a thin energy beam first at the floor and then rising to the ceiling. This attack occurs fairly reliably and can't be flinched.\r\n- Once Safi'jiiva is close to death (skull icon on minimap) and has run out of energy, it will regularly perform the ring explosion attack. At this point, the attack will also spawn crags.\r\n- This attack can be flinched, causing no crags to drop. The following Supernova will lead to a full party wipe!\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, a few things can be done:\r\n\r\n**Avoid the \"Desperation mode\" entirely**\r\n-  \r\nForce Safi'jiiva to drain all the Energy from the area fast by triggering the events above. Safi'jiiva can't heal without energy in the current area. Then slay Safi'jiiva as soon as possible, so it never runs out of energy. High damage is needed for this.\r\n \r\n\r\n**Run Away**\r\n-  \r\nWhile the active Supernova disables farcasters, you can use one just before it. Safi'jiiva actually lowers its body for a second before it jumps in the air. If you notice this and there are no rocks in the area, use your Farcaster fast. You just might escape.\r\n \r\n\r\n**Tank it**\r\n-  \r\nUtilizing the food skills `Felyne Insurance` (Daily Skill) and `Felyne Safeguard` (6 Alcoholic Ingredients), you can get up to 5 possible faints. Do keep in mind that multiple iterations of the same skill don't stack.\r\n \r\n\r\n**Stagger Safi'jiiva out of the air**\r\n-  \r\nYou need to use a `Flash Pod` or a Bomb Pod on Safi'jiiva before the Supernova animation begins. Note that Safi'jiiva will develop immunity to pods, so you can't use multiple ones in a row. Alternatively, you can drop Safi'jiiva down to the ground by triggering paralysis or sleep.\r\n \r\n\r\n**Other scenarios of full party wipes:**\r\n- Untimely flash: If Safi performs a supernova when it's NOT enraged, and this nova gets interrupted by a Flash Pod, it's possible that Safi performs another nova very soon after the first one, when there's not any crag on the ground yet. The detailed mechanics is not clear, but normally Safi becomes enraged after the second nova, so it might be a nova to reset enmity after losing track of hunters. This can happen at any time in phase 3, not restrict to the \"Desperate mode\".\r\n### Recommended Skills\r\n-  \r\n**Partbreaker**: pretty much mandatory as the main goal of the siege is to break as many parts as possible before slaying the monster. Lv3 recommended.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Health Boost**: Recommended because of Safi's high damage output.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Fire Resistance**: having fire resistance of 20 or above prevents being affected by `Fireblight`.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Coalescence**: alternatively you can choose to profit from Fireblight to give yourself a damage boost.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Safi'jiiva Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Safi'jiiva Master Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n### Safi'jiiva Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Safi'jiiva Monster. \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \n\n\r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- Can't be lured\r\n- When both parts of the name are translated in their respective languages it will roughly translate to: \"Pure being imbued with life/power\"\r\n- It is the second monster (after `Shara Ishvalda`) to have a \"Switch Display\" option in its Physiology and Rewards pages. \n  - Unlike Shara Ishvalda, however, the two displays are unchanged in terms of appearance - the only differences are the body parts they highlight.\r\n- It is the first monster to have more than one display for listing all of its breakable body parts and their respective awards.\r\n \r\n- Since Xeno'jiiva lured Zorah Magdaros towards the Elders Recess, Safi'jiiva most likely lured it towards the Secluded Valley, where it died and formed the Guiding Lands out of its carcass and bioenergy.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

It is a variant of `Brachydios`.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Raging Brachydios Details & Locations\r\n- Found in: `Guiding Lands` (quest only)\r\n- Target of Quests: `...And My Rage for All  `and `Achy Brachy Heart`.\r\n- Is hostile immediately\r\n- Size: Raging Brachydios does not vary in size and is always 2282.77cm.\r\n- Species: `Brute Wyverns`\r\n- HP: 28.120(Solo), ~48,982(Duo), ~73,112(3 or 4 players)\r\n\r\n \r\n### Raging Brachydios Combat Info\r\n- Kinsect Extracts: \n  - : Head/Arms/Tip of tail.\r\n- : Torso/Body.\r\n- : Hindlegs.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Normal mode:** Permanently covered in Yellow Slime that explodes faster then the regular green slime. The slime on its hands, head and tail will over time switch to red, the so called \"Flashpoint Slime\" Once Red, its attacks will trigger explosions pretty much instantly. The Flashpoint Slime can be washed off by hitting it with melee attacks, water element attacks or watermoss. However, watch your step, as this will cause the slime to fall off and detonate.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Enraged mode:** Indicated by a short Pause and a Roar. All Areas of its body immediately switch to Flashpoint Slime. Glows stronger and coats area with slime, areas of the body will glow red including arms, head, shoulders, back , and the end of its tail. This is also a warning sign that its attacks will cause explosions on impact. Hitting slime lodged on its body with Watermoss or Slinger Bombs can dislodge them.  Watch out as this will leave an explosive Slime Puddle underneath the part, that explodes after roughly 2 Seconds\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Recommended Skills:** `Blast Resistance`, `Health Boost`,  `Earplugs`, `Tool Maintenance`, `Ice Attack`, `Evade Distance`, `Evade Window`\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Best Specialized Tools:** `Fireproof Mantle` (if the player does not have level 3 Antiblast), `Temporal Mantle`, `Evasion Mantle`.\r\n \r\n- **Best Items:** Health items including `Max Potions`, `Lifepowders`, and `Dust of Life` to heal you and your teammates, `Cool Drink` to prevent heat damage from the volcanic area and reduce the heat damage caused by the heated slime secreted by the monster during its final battle phase. Traps for DPS opportunities, `Flash Pods` for creating windows to heal/sharpen/retreat.\r\n-  \r\nIt's recommended to use weapons that deal  Ice Damage as it's the monsters greatest elemental weakness.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n`Sticky Ammo 3` is very effective against it especially if playing in a team. The sticky ammo will knock down the monster and stun it allowing teammates to safely attack.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n`Flash Pods` are very useful to create an opening for healing, or stopping an incoming attack. However, be warned as with all master rank monsters they gain  resistance to being flashed. The resistance will go away after a while.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nOnce Raging Brachydios retreats to the Nest Area of the Volcanic Region, head back to camp to stock up on Ammo and Potions. Once the first player enters the Area, Raging Brachydios will perform a flashy move, that blocks the exits of the Area, preventing any escape (even by `Farcaster`). Traps are also disabled, including the Palico Thundertrap (yes, they patched it). The Area can still be entered through its southern entrance.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nRaging Brachydios' mechanics completely change in this phase. Instead of just punching you, Raging Brachydios is mostly focused on spreading its completely released Flashpoint slime all over the Area. The slime deals much more damage on contact in this phase. Once a lot of slime is spread, the Raging Brachydios will roar (indicated by a camera Zoom-Out) detonating every puddle of slime in the room. The explosion is so violent it even damages the Raging Brachydios (84 Damage), which can be used to slay it for a good laugh.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nAs stated above, this monster is currently uncapturable and must be slain in order to complete the quest `....And My Rage for All`, which is the only quest where it can be fought or encountered; there are no Raging Brachydios Investigations (though they have been announced to come with a future update).\r\n \r\n-  \r\nIt is best to make good use of the `Clutch Claw` and knock down the monster as often as possible\r\n \r\n-  \r\nDue to the fact that Raging Brachydios is much larger than a regular Brachydios it becomes more of a threat, as its large size allows it to hit players much more easier due to its larger hit boxes.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nRaging Brachydios has a similar move set to a regular Brachydios. However, it both has a more potent set of attacks and a few moves unique to the variant.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Specific Combat Tips**\r\n-  \r\nUnless you want to heal or retreat to get more Supplies, DON'T BACK UP. Raging Brachydios has three extremely long range attacks with large hitboxes and huge damage. Staying close to it and chipping away at its legs and fists is much safer. Unless you use ranged weapons, of course.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nDon't dodge away from Raging Brachydios, dodge into it. Raging Brachydios moves forward with most attacks, so dodging through them is much safer than dodging away from them.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nRaging Brachydios might be terrifying on the offense, but it doesn't have much health. Using a `Pitfall Trap` of `Shock Trap` early on will allow you to deal a large amount of damage, dramatically speeding up the fight. Raging Brachydios cannot be captured anyway, so using traps as a damaging tool is a good idea, though their effectiveness is greatly reduced after the third one.\r\n \r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Areas and their Advantages**\r\n-  \r\nArea 2 (Start)\r\n-  \r\nThis is where every Raging Brachydios hunt begins. It's not that great. Use the Scatternuts to execute the slinger burst, watch out for Raging Brachydios' punches and move on as fast as possible.\r\n \r\n \r\n-  \r\nArea 3\r\n-  \r\nIt's rare that Raging Brachydios even stops here, it usually moves on to the next area if you deal enough damage early on. Use the massive Slide in the north of this Area to get some easy mounts and move on to the next area.\r\n \r\n \r\n-  \r\nArea 5 (Middle Part)\r\n-  \r\nYou will be here quite some time if your damage isn't great. The Ledges are good for mounting or Dual Blades, as is the narrow slide you enter this area through. There are also several Poisoncups for poisoning and a `paratoad`, `nitrotoads`, and a `sleeptoad`; use all of this and beat up Raging Brachydios until it retreats to the Volcanic region.\r\n \r\n \r\n-  \r\nArea 14 (End Phase)\r\n-  \r\nWelcome to Hell! Don't forget your `Cool Drink`. This is where a large part of the fight is spent. Which is bad because there's no cover, lava everywhere and only one environmental aid in form of the volcano. Use the ledge in the room for mounts and lure Raging Brachydios to the active Volcano (you can tell it's activating by the floor shaking). Stand your ground and bully Raging Brachydios to its nest.\r\n \r\n \r\n-  \r\nArea 15 (Last Stand)\r\n-  \r\nIf you managed to get this far, good work. The hardest part is behind you. Stock up on items before you enter though, just to be safe. Use the slope to maneuver around Raging Brachydios and the `Flashpoint Slime`, Avoid the Slimeprints as much as possible and enjoy the fireworks.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Raging Brachydios Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Raging Brachydios Master Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n### Raging Brachydios Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Raging Brachydios Monster. **These are unconfirmed and pre-release information for now!**\r\n## \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- It is known as the \"Crushing Wyvern\".\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Lightning constantly runs through its fur.\r\n- Furious Rajang will constantly be in its powered up mode, making it more aggressive and its attacks quicker. It will never revert back to its black fur form until it is slain.\r\n- Since it's always in its powered up mode, Furious Rajang can enrage at any time, entering its even more powerful Rampage Mode shortly after. Without wounding it, you won't be able to attacks its arms at all in this mode!\r\n- Furious Rajang does not have a tail (which is why it is Furious) and thus its only weakpoint is its arms/head, which can be hard to hit, tenderizing it's hindlegs can be extremely useful but difficult to manage considering how aggressive this monster is in shaking you off.\r\n- Attacking its head while it is in its Rampage mode (arms glow red and attacks bounce off) will make it end faster.\r\n- Furious Rajang has multiple attacks that can hit behind him - be careful of his 'goat-kicker' (his back leg just kicking) and of course always be ready to roll. Still, attacking from behind is your safest strategy.\r\n- Furious Ragang enrages rather easily and triggers its Rampage mode very fast. Weaken its Arms with a `Clutch Claw` attack to avoid deflection, be advised that since Furious Rajang is extremely fast, pulling of the `Clutch Claw` attack might be tough.\r\n- Since Furious Rajang has no tail, you stop its rampage mode by dealing damage to its head. Be very careful though, as Furious Rajang's attacks are most devastating if you are in front of it.\r\n- Furious Rajang will destroy Shock Traps during rampage mode(red arms), will ignore Pitfall Traps when not enraged and can still attack out of a `Pitfall Trap`.\r\n- It is definitely recommended to avoid getting pinned, since Furious Rajang's pin attack will easily deal more than 50% of your health (with `Health Boost` 3) and knock you down, inflict `Thunderblight`, and most likely `Stun`, it, however, can't kill you (like Safi'jiiva's pin, it will leave you at 1hp).\r\n- Using a `Flash Pod` on Furious Rajang while someone is pinned will free the pinned hunter.\r\n- The final attack of Furious Rajang's pin deals heavy damage around him, not just the hunter that has been pinned so be wary.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Furious Rajang Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Furious Rajang Low and High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n### Furious Rajang Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Furious Rajang Monster. \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- Furious Rajangs Fury comes from losing its Tail to a hunter in its early years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

The two event quests (Evening Star and Death Star) rotate daily and depend on the date the player completed Blazing Black Twilight. In `Blazing Black Twilight`, `Dawn's Triumph`, and `The Evening Star`, Alatreon starts in Fire Active. In `Dawn of the Death Star`, Alatreon starts in Ice Active.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nAlatreon can use attack from any element in any form, though he tends to prioritize the ones that corresponds to his active state.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nUnless you can beat him without mistakes, elemental damage is essential against Alatreon, as doing enough elemental damage will weaken his supernova, which will cart the hunter in almost every case if not weakened.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nAlatreon's elemental weakness changes depending on its active element and is extremely resistant to all ailments.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nKinsect Extracts:\r\n-  \r\n: Head\r\n \r\n-  \r\n: Legs\r\n \r\n-  \r\n: Wings\r\n \r\n \r\n###  \r\n### Elemental Rotatation\r\n\r\nAlatreon has three elemental states: **Fire**, **Dragon** and **Ice**, through which he will circle during the hunt. Alatreon switches elements every 3 minutes. Depending on the quest you fight Alatreon in, the rotation will be different.\r\n-  \r\nIn both Special Assignments and the Event Quest \"The Evening Star\", Alatreon will start in **Fire Active** and switch as follows:\r\n-  \r\n**Fire** to **Dragon** to **Ice** to **Dragon** to **Fire**\r\n \r\n \r\n-  \r\nIn the Event Quest \"Dawn of the Death Star\", Alatreon will start in **Ice Active** and switch as follows:\r\n-  \r\n**Ice **to **Dragon **to **Fire **to **Dragon **to **Ice**\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nEvery time Alatreon Switches from** Dragon **to the** next element **he will perform Escaton Judgement. Hopefully, Alatreon's power has been contained enough at this point to make the attack survivable. By breaking Alatreon's horns when in **Dragon active, **the next Elemental State can be avoided, and Alatreon will be forced to switch back to the previous element. The rotation of the elements resets back to the start.\r\n-  \r\n**Example: **If Alatreon switched from **Fire** to **Dragon** and you break his horns, he will be forced to switch to **Fire **again, after he performs the Escaton Judgement. If you failed to break his horns, he will switch to** Ice**.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nUnless the group uses mostly Dragon weapons for some reason, eliminating either **Fire Active **or **Ice Active** from the rotation is critical to success.\r\n \r\n### Strategies\r\n-  \r\nIf you aren't in Blazing Black Twilight (or after a cart in that quest), take the crystalburst at camp. It will always stagger Alatreon, and it can save your life if you get pinned.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nA great way to start the fight is to have Temporal/Rocksteady equipped, immediately claw onto his head, claw him twice, then flinch shot him into the wall directly behind him. It's a bit luck dependent if he charges forward or does the lightning attack, but the charge forward is what you should be looking for.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nAlthough Water and Thunder are marked as 2 stars weaknesses for Fire and Ice Active respectively, Fire and Ice are a lot more effective against their counterpart, even though they are only marked 1 star higher.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nIce damage is effective against fire Alatreon, and vice versa. Dragon is awful against Alatreon unless you have a lot of trouble breaking his horns. If you are using fire or ice element, breaking his horns is vital to keeping Alatreon in the opposite element after he does Escaton Judgement. If he switches to the same element as your weapons, no attacks will contribute to the elemental topple until he switches back to Dragon, leaving you a very small window to build up element to weaken the next nova.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nFrostfang Barioth weapons are highly recommended against his fire active quests if you do not have Kjárr weapons. \r\n \r\n-  \r\nA popular strategy is to wait until Alatreon goes into Dragon Active before wall-slamming him, since it deals heavy damage to his horns.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nAlatreon can be very tricky to wall-slam, as it only works if he hits one of the three big rock formations on the edge of the arena. Alternatively, Alatreon can be slammed down to the ground when he's flying. If you don't have Temporal Mantle equipped, one great opportunity to flinch shot him to the ground is to wait until after he does the two head pounds, then clutch claw and flinch shot.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nAlatreon can be stunned with Flash Pods (even out of the air), but only when he's not enraged.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nConsider staying on the floor after getting hit, as Alatreon comboes a lot of his moves, and staying on the ground leaves you invincible.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nGood Luck Pal! You're gonna need it!\r\n \r\n### Surviving Escaton Judgement\r\n-  \r\nEscaton Judgement, Alatreon's Ultimate Attack. It is indicated by the entire Arena filling with Frost of Fire and the Sound getting notably muffled. After roughly five seconds, Alatreon releases a massive, arena-wide elemental blast, that deals a set amount of damage in 5 seconds.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nThe Supernova functions identically to Lunastra's Supernova. Only this time, there is no running from it. The damage is dealt in form of red recoverable health without stagger or knockback. It is not possible to i-frame it, and it will not trigger Vigorwasp Revival. Dodging, including the Superman dive, and most mantles are useless. \r\n \r\n- Dealing enough elemental damage to Alatreon will cause him to do a special topple animation (similar to `Velkhana` when you break her ice armor), followed by a big rumble if you use controller. Once this happens, the next Escaton Judgment will be severely weakened.\r\n-  \r\nThe damage dealt by the nova is dependent on how many times Alatreon has been toppled through elemental damage before Escaton Judgment. This counter resets after every EJ. Note that every weapon has a \"elemental multiplier,\" which allows weapons that are not normally elemental focused to also pass the DPS check. \r\n-  \r\n0 times: The supernova deals 1000 damage in 5 seconds. It is only possible to survive this nova through extreme coordination and perfect timing, but you shouldn't count on that. Improbable, not impossible.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n1 time: Deals around 280 damage. Easily survivable with two Astera Jerkies / Sushifish Scales / Max Potions without Health Boost or Health Booster. If you have 200 health without Speed Eating, you can time using one Astera Jerky at 4 ticks of damage, and survive with about 100 health.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n2 times: The supernova now only deals 140 damage in 5 Seconds, making it completely survivable without healing if you start at full 150 health.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n3+ times: Alatreons Power is fully contained and the Supernova deals a miniscule amount of damage.\r\n \r\n \r\n- Players can survive Escaton Judgment more easily by getting together and placing down their Health Boosters at the same spot, since they stack. Lifepowder and Dust of Life can be also be beneficial.*\r\n- \r\n### Recommended Skills\r\n-  \r\n**Health Boost**: Extremely useful considering Alatreon's high damage output.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Blight Resistance**: All Alatreon attacks are elemental, and can inflict blights, this skill eliminates a huge part of the hassle of this fight.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Dragon Resistance**: Since `Dragonblight` shuts down your elemental damage (required to weaken Escaton Judgment), it is very important to make sure you aren't hit by this blight. Having a dragon resistance of 20 or more will prevent him from inflicting Dragonblight, but you still will be hit by other blights, which in turn will proc Coalescence.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Coalescence**: This is almost a free damage boost considering how many blights Alatreon inflicts to the hunters. Note that Blight Resistance lv3 will nullify Coalescence (use lv2 instead).\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Agitator**: Alatreon stays in enraged state for a very long time, making this skill very good.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Fortify**: Mainly useful if you intend to bruteforce Alatreon by ignoring his elemental damage mechanics.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Alatreon Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Alatreon Low and High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n### Alatreon Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Alatreon Monster.\r\n## \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- It is known as the \"Blazing Black Dragon\".\r\n- Alatreon has the most physiology diagrams of any monster, one for each of its active states. \n  - Unlike Shara Ishvalda, the displays only differ in terms of elemental weaknesses, not physical design.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

This will take you on a quest to defeat an Alatreon with much less health than normal. After you have defeated `Alatreon`, you will obtain the quest \"`The Black Dragon`\" as a special assignment.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nThe start of this quest is solo only. After taking down about 22% of his total health, a cutscene will play and multiplayer will permanently be unlocked for the quest, even if you return back from it.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nThe Special Assignment version of the quest allows for up to 5 carts, the Event Quest version (`Fade to Black`) only for up to 3. \r\n \r\n-  \r\n**First Nova**: Fatalis will do the first area wide flame breath after losing about 22% of his health. You can only hide from this in a shelter on the right side of the arena, which is the same area you ran to with your NPC companion during the solo cutscene. After this nova the back of the arena will be unlocked, which includes multiple more siege weapons.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Second Nova**: Performed after losing 50% of his health. You can only survive this one by running at the gate in the back of the arena and pulling the lever before the big flame comes out. Fatalis will enter his 3rd and final phase after this one.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Third/Fourth/Fifth Nova**: Performed when Fatalis has 38%/20%/5% health left. You need to run towards Fatalis in order to avoid it. Since the Nova is cone shaped, it is recommended to run towards the sides rather than the center to get out of it faster.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nAfter the second Nova, Fatalis will have a glowing chest. During this phase he gains new attacks (of which one can pin you) and all of his attacks become much more dangerous.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nBreaking Fatalis's head once will weaken the attacks in the 3rd phase. Breaking it twice will reduce the damage even more(back to the same damage from phase 1 and 2).\r\n \r\n-  \r\nThe arena for the fight has multiple siege weapons, including three cannons, two ballistae, a roaming ballista and the Dragonator. There are also two one-shot binders (one near the wall behind the roaming ballista and the other one behind the ballista on the opposite side of the arena) that can be used to restrain Fatalis. Note that Fatalis tends to focus any player trying to operate siege weaponry.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nFatalis will be knocked down up to two times if he received enough damage through siege weapons. The first knockdown will happen after 1000 damage, the second one after 3000 damage. `Heavy Artillery` will increase the damage from siege weapons making it easier to knock down Fatalis with the siege weapons.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nEach head of the Dragonator will deal damage equivalent to 5% of Fatalis's total health. Note that the Dragonator hitbox is much bigger than it looks.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nFlinch shotting Fatalis when he's standing on two feet will cause him to go down on all fours. Only in this position Fatalis can be wall-slammed.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nEvery second Dragon Pod shot on Fatalis will make him flinch and interrupt his current attack. Fatalis will naturally drop dragon pods throughout the hunt, but you can also make him drop them through clutch attacks.\r\n \r\n-  \r\nBecause Fatalis is the hardest fight in the game, it is not recommended to tackle it until you have access to a fully optimized endgame setup, if possible with health augment for melee weapons (only unlocked after MR100 for R12 weapons).\r\n \r\n### Recommended Skills\r\n-  \r\n**Health Boost:** Fatalis hits extremely hard and several of his attacks can even one shot melee players.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Divine Blessing:** See above.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Fire Resistance: **Almost all of his attacks are fire based and inflict Fireblight.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Blight Resistance: **Use Blight Resistance if Fire Resistance of 20 or above is not possible for your build.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Coalescence: **An almost guaranteed damage boost provided you aren't immune to Fireblight.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Agitator:** Fatalis stays enraged rather long, so this is a good damage boost.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Partbreaker:** Makes it easier to break his head.\r\n \r\n-  \r\n**Heavy Artillery:** Increases the damage dealt with ballistae and cannons.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Fatalis Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Fatalis Rewards\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n### Fatalis Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Fatalis Monster. \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- It is known as the \"Black Dragon\".\r\n- This is the final monster added to Monster Hunter World: Iceborne.\r\n- Fatalis was the final online boss for the first Monster Hunter game on the Playstation 2.\r\n- Monster Hunter World: Iceborne marks the first game in the Monster Hunter series where Fatalis has a proper UI icon; it was previously only signified with a question mark.\r\n- According to legend, the kingdom of Schrade was felled by **one** Fatalis.\r\n- Many consider Fatalis as the lord of all monsters for its power and intelligence.\r\n- Fatalis' MHWI render was taken from the Monster Hunter 15th Anniversary poster. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Impressive turf war with `Deviljho`.\r\n- Often arrives to your fights with other large monsters and engages in turf wars with them. If you are having trouble tracking or finding it, attack the nearest large monster you can find and it is likely to deal with the hard part of tracking for you.\r\n- In the Wildspire Waste, when Bazelgeuse charges at you, it can kill Kelbies that in turn will drop their horns.\r\n- Sizes: 1696.97 ~ 2410.48\r\n- Species: Flying Wyverns\r\n- HP: ~9,191(Solo), ~13,650(Duo), ~20,384(3 or 4 players)\r\n\r\n \r\n### Bazelgeuse Combat Info\r\n- Elemental damages: N/A (Blast)\r\n- Weak to `Thunder` element, and to `Dragon` and`Ice` to a lesser degree\r\n- Can inflict `Fireblight` on hunters.\r\n- Only moderately susceptible to ```Poison`, ```Sleep` and ```Paralysis`\r\n- The head is the weakest spot, followed by the tail that hunters can cut\r\n- Hunters can also target the wings, but they are more resistant than the head and tail\r\n- The chest portion can be broken\r\n- Friction and heat cause the pods it drops to explode. When it's red, they explode immediately. When it's black, it needs to hit them (including its dive bomb) to make them explode. You can also detonate the pods manually by firing slinger ammos or any projectile to the pods.\r\n- When in the air, will have 2-3 flying passes to drop pods on the ground, and will dive bomb you on the last run and make them explode\r\n- Has a rarely-used front fire blast.\r\n- Likes to dig its head in the ground and charge you, leaving it wide open for attacks when it completes the move.\r\n- The scales that Bazelgeuse scatters explode with tremendous force, making them extremely deadly. Focus on its legs to knock it down, and then knock out its scale-generating organs under its chin and tail. (Severing the tail reduces the amount of bombs released at once, but the tail stump still keeps a few after the tail is severed.)\r\n- If Bazelgeuse shows up at an inopportune time, `Dung Pods` can be used to scare it away.

It is possible to use a farcaster before the items lock and still be invincible as the EM hits. \n  \r\n- Bring healing items to help your teammates such as Lifepowder. 3 on hand and 10 combination reserves will ensure everyone stays alive.\r\n- Bring Mega Barrel Bombs to place when it falls asleep.\r\n- The boss summons COMETS. Your team should drop them in accessible areas of the arena.\r\n- When the large meteor AOE comes, put the COMET between you and the middle of the arena where the large meteor will land. The floor turns red and the boss glows red as a signal.\r\n- When Charybdis is cast, a player will be selected with a gust of wind similar to the starting of a Kushala Tornado. Move closer to a wall if possible to ensure that the team isn't affected during combat.  \n  - If you are playing with randoms and your teammates are dropping tornados everywhere, you can use a Flashpod to stop the cast.\r\n- Be aware that flashpods reset Enemity (aggro), so they should be used sparingly\r\n \r\n- If you have played FF14 before you will notice that Behemoth has distinct skills that have areas to position your team in. - For example the Thunderbolt, standing either on the side, behind or in the spaces between his head and arm are the safest places to stand. If you are his target it is better to stand in the spaces between his hand and arm or you risk wiping your team if he turns around suddenly on a teammate.\r\n- Similar with Thundaga, his Eruption is the same 3 directions however it is telegraphed more clearly and is not used more than once at a time.\r\n- Meteor can be blocked but chunks for a lot, it is better to super man dive or avoid completely.\r\n- The player with Enmity should move Behemoth away from any tornadoes and comet.\r\n- If it stumbles, everyone focuses the same weak point they focused before, repeat until broken. If it sleeps, sleep bomb and have your range special shot the barrel if no GS/Hammer is present.\r\n### Behemoth Battle\r\n- Phase 1- The battle will start in the cave with 2 destructible stalactites each doing about 1.7k, this will be the easiest and quickest phase if you manage to get even one of them to hit behemoth, he will only use Meteor and Charybdis in this phase.\r\n- Phase 2- He will run to the next zone, where the first person who enters with be met with a Charybdis cast or a meteor and most of the Enmity. in this phase he will use his skills more often and sometimes in rapid succession and his meteor will now target all hunters. he gains two new moves Thunderbolt and Comet. Thunderbolt can and usually is used 3 times in a row, but its possible to blind him and stop the triple cast. Once Comet falls you MUST make sure that at least one rock stays up to hide behind when he uses ecliptic meteor at the end of the phase or you will instantly be carted.\r\n- Phase 3 - He will run again and there you will be met with objects that can be used to mount without an IG (Its not confirmed but I'm almost positive they cannot shield you from ecliptic meteor then even if they manage to stay up). same as phase 2 you must make sure at least one rock is up to have any chance of surviving at the end of the phase.\r\n- Phase 4 - He will run one last time to the nergi nest, there here will stand waiting for you, both destructible walls are already broken down. similar to phase 2-3. you must survive yet again and this time finally kill him and carve from the remains.\r\n- It is worth noting that if everyone leaves the zone he is currently in he will begin to regenerate health.\r\n- He may flee into the zone with heat hazard, so bring cold drinks, if he does run to this zone, he may run back to his previous zone after the 3rd phase.\r\n- The ecliptic meteor, while not map wide, is far enough to reach all adjacent zones, you will not be able to run from the blast nor can you escape by any conventional means such as fast-traveling to camp (be it via farcaster or wingdrakes). Item usage is locked as soon as Behemoth casts ecliptic meteor, likewise anyone who are foolish enough to try and stay in camp area's tent will be booted out of the tent automatically, rendering any of these options obsolete. It is, however, possible to bypass ecliptic meteor's effect by eating in the canteen should one be close enough to a canteen table.\r\n- you can control how the behemoth moves while mounted, depending on which section you're clinging to. If you aren't familiar with these patterns, it's **** to mount behemoth for prolonged periods of time (ergo infinite mount strategy) as Behemoth will continue to thrash around more erratically the longer it is mounted\\\r\n\\\r\n\r\n- It is highly recommended to put the Behemoth to sleep under a boulder in Phase 1. The boulder's damage will be doubled as a wake up hit akin to any other source of damage, surpassing several Mega barrel bomb worth of damage combined. Likewise, using both boulders in Phase 1 will essentially allow for a faster run overall.\r\n- Do  assume any of your random party members will flash to cancel Charybdis; always assume your due diligence/ responsibility of flashing a Charybdis aimed at you personally and be proactive on finding an area's edge to go to in case Behemoth's head clips through a wall thus rendering flash cancelling Charybdis impossible. Sole focus on damage dealing is neither useful nor helpful; do not be \"that guy\".\r\n- Always do a head count prior to starting a random hunt; if there is a support tank in there (e.g. barroth lance user with guard up/ guard 5, etc) then let them gain enmity. If and when the system works, this will cause behemoth to cast Charybdis on a much lesser frequency as well as ensuring Behemoth only casting meteor on said tank. \\\r\n\\\r\nAny IG or S&S hunters in the midst should always aim to finish mounting as soon as possible, instead of the mythical infinite mount strategy as enmity resets after a few minutes. Wasting enmity active time would only cause more sporadic Charybdis and meteors being cast on the long run. Stay on your lanes.\r\n### Kinsect Spots\r\n- Green: Neck, Torso, and Back\r\n- Red: Forearms\r\n- Orange: Head and Tail\r\n- White: Hind(back) legs\r\n### Behemoth Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Behemoth Low and High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Behemoth Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Behemoth Monster. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Behemoth Armor\r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- Behemoth is a Free DLC update in collaboration with Final Fantasy XIV.

It was added in a free update on March 22, 2018(Console) & September 6,2018(PC) and was not part of the game's original launch. \r\n\r\n \r\n### Deviljho Details & Locations\r\n- Found in: all Locales.\r\n- Target of Assignment Quest: `The Food Chain Dominator`, `Today's Special: Hunter Flambé`, \\\r\n`Relish The Moment`(Event Quest)\r\n- Is immediately hostile at any range\r\n- Will attack anything. Has unique Turf Wars with `Diablos` and `Bazelgeuse`, and a shared Turf War with `Legiana` and `Rathalos`.\r\n- Has the unique ability to swing fanged wyverns around as a weapon. Some include: `Great Jagras`, `Kulu-Ya-Ku`, `Tzitzi-Ya-Ku`, `Tobi-Kadachi`, `Odogaron`, `Great Girros` and `Dodogama`. If these monsters are on low health he kills them with the throw animation then proceeds to eat them. For monsters too big to pick up, he will occasionally \"take a bite,\" out of them, dealing a decent amount of damage (seems to be 500, even in solo). For these reasons, he can serve as a valuable \"ally,\" for a hunter, so long as they steer clear of it.\r\n- Will eat from corpses of slain large monsters.\r\n- `Small Monsters` version: None\r\n- Sizes:  ~ \r\n- Species: `Brute Wyverns`\r\n- Health: ~8,888(Solo), ~13,200(Duo), ~19,712(3 or 4 players)\r\n\r\nDeviljho will invade 6★ `Quests`, 7★ `Quests`, and high rank expeditions once players have completed the investigation for the “`??? Rathian`” in the main story. When players load up they will get a prompt saying that Deviljho is found somewhere in the world. For the fastest way to find it:\r\n- Load up your world map and check all the locations for a ??? Monster\r\n- If there is no ??? Monster, head to any area.\r\n- Once in that area, bring up your world map again and check again to see if it appeared\r\n- Once you find ??? Monster, head into that area.\r\n\r\nIt is best to collect it tracks and capture it but slaying it is fine too.  Note that you do not have to hunt it at this point, collecting tracks is enough. After players have done so, head back to Astera to check in with the jovial researcher for a cutscene; this will unlock the Deviljho special assignment. Players will have to hunt a Deviljho in Ancient Forest. Hunters will be able to acquire the new mantle, `Dragonproof Mantle`, after completing the mission.\r\n\r\n`Dragonproof Mantle`\r\n- Increases dragon damage while increasing dragon resistance. \n  - This mantle will be good while using Deviljho’s weapons or any dragon element weapon.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Deviljho Combat Info\r\n- This monster deals `Dragon` and `Dragonblight` damage.\r\n- Deviljho is weak to `Thunder` and `Dragon`\r\n- Hunters should attack its weakpoints in the Head, Belly and Tail, which can be broken\r\n- Can inflict `Defense Down` with the monsters it uses as bludgeons, or by picking up the hunter with its mouth\r\n- The rocks thrown by Deviljho can inflict different status ailments depending on the terrain: \n  - `Fireblight` in lava terrain\r\n- `Iceblight` in icy terrain\r\n- `Waterblight` in water terrain\r\n- `Effluvial Buildup` in the `Rotten Vale`\r\n \r\n- Be cautious when using Pitfall Traps: Deviljho swings its head around violently and will damage anyone directly in front of it while trapped. \n  - Use PitFall Traps on Deviljho when it is exhausted. Sign of exhaust are standing still panting with its jaws drooling. That way, it will not be able to attack you while trapped.\r\n \r\n- While not in Combt, Deviljho will eat any corpse or corpse part he comes across. This does include its own severed Tail. Deviljho also takes bites of captured monsters\r\n- **Master Rank Changes**- If you find Deviljho annoying, rejoice! Because Deviljho is not in Master Rank.\r\n- He gets replaced by the hungrier, tankier, far more dangerous Savage Deviljho.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Deviljho Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Deviljho Low and High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Deviljho Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Deviljho Monster.\r\n## \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- This Monster is of the Brute Wyvern species.\r\n- A popular fan nickname for Deviljho is The Pickle, or Picklejho.\r\n- Deviljho is known as the \"Violent Wyvern\".\r\n- Deviljho can appear in some 7 star  Ancient Forest High Rank optionals by placing a raw meat on the map.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Its charging attack, while devastatingly powerful, can be baited into colliding with a wildspire, momentarily getting Diablos stuck.\r\n- Diablos is surprisingly quick and has a deceivingly large range, so be ready to dodge whenever the monster begins an animation.\r\n- Diablos is most powerful at the start of the fight. An effective strategy is to kite it around the arena, tiring it out.

Its scales are extremely sensitive to arid conditions, where they become brittle and the monster's cutaneous respiration also plummets in efficacy. Jyuratodus regularly stays well moisturized by covering itself in a thick layer of mud. In fact, being predisposed to wetland conditions, the Jyuratodus usually spends most of its days submerged in the waters of its marshy den. This is why the Jyuratodus is a strongly territorial monster that will not hesitate to attack any intruder who disturbs its otherwise peaceful existence. The Jyuratodus attempts to reduce such intrusions by marking the outskirts of its territory with mud.\r\n- Mud doesn't just protect the Jyuratodus, It's also useful in battle. Jyuratodus regularly stores mud and dirt within its body and mixes it with a special water inside its water sac to make a very thick mud concoction. The Jyuratodus will expel this highly viscous mixture at an enemy in hopes of hitting it and significantly impeding its movement. Jyuratodus is also instinctively aware that many other creatures suffer limited movement in marshlands and will skillfully utilize a variety of offensive maneuvers that take advantage of this disparity, such as attacking from the depths of the swamp.\r\n- Jyuratodus are capable of walking on two legs when they cross over obstacles or hunt Apceros. These hind legs were originally extremely powerful fins and are dexterous tucked in close to the Jyuratodus's body while it swims. Even excluding these hind legs, you may be wondering why a Jyuratodus has more fins than a standard fish. The surprising benefit of these numerous fins is that they serve dual purpose of improving balance by distributing its body wight while the massive Jyuratodus is on land, and aiding propulsion and balance when the monster is swimming. In order to deal with gravity on land and buoyancy in water, the Jyuratodus slightly adjusts its many fins when moving about. Recent findings of ancient Piscine Wyvern fossils with numerous fins suggest that Jyuratodus has maintained this body structure for a very long time.\r\n- A Jyuratodus only feeds about once per day by preying on Aptonoths or other water-seeking herbivorous wyverns. The inside of its mouth is lined with rows of sharp meat-tearing fangs arranged on a dental plate, and its powerful jaw can crack open its prey's bones. An analysis of Jyuratodus's feeding remains suggests that they prefer to eat organs, a trait probably related to their juvenile feeding habits.\r\n- While traveling through marshes, the Jyuratodus leaves behind muddy piles that serve as natural boundary markers for its territory.  However, the competing Barroths often destroys these markers while roaming through marshes, leading to territorial conflict between the two monsters should they cross paths. As their natural abilities and strength are comparable, many consider them to be fierce rivals.\r\n- Jyuratodus predominantly spawn during the rainy season. Large numbers of Jyuratodus gather in the marshlands where the females directly release their unfertilized eggs. Male Jyuratodus will respond in turn by depositing their gametes in the same vicinity with hopes of fertilizing the eggs. This reproductive ritual creates a rather novel scenes as the surface of the marsh will suddenly and violently appear to undulate. Altough many eggs are successfully fertilized and even hatch, only a small handful of the hatchlings survive to maturity due to predation by other fish and cannibalism among juvenile Jyuratodus. Since this ritual only occurs during particularly turbulent rainy seasons, it's a rare event that hasn't been recorded in recent years.\r\n- Jyuratodus are carnivorous from a young age and display a unique feeding behavior. They enter the body of their prey through its mouth, nostrils, or even an open wound. They will then proceed to devour the prey from the inside out. Note the barbed spines seen on the gills of adult Jyuratodus. These are believed to be remnants from its juvenile form, where the spikes would prevent the Jyuratodus from being expelled from their prey's body.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

After pilfering a nest, it will return to its own abode and devour the egg. This protective behavior reduces its chances of being spotted by any foes. On average a Kulu-Ya-Ku consumes the highly nutritious yolk of three to four eggs every day.\r\n- Kulu-Ya-Ku avoid repeatedly targeting a single nest. This is why you can easily spot them traversing the Wildspire Waste's swamps and forests, and almost everywhere in between. Outside of eating and sleeping, the Kulu-Ya-Ku spends most of its time surveying nests, staying hydrated by drinking water several times a day, and frequently grooming the decorative feathers on its arms, which also aid in marking territory.\r\n- A Kulu-Ya-Ku may be camouflaged by its scales, but note the feathers growing on its head and forelimbs. These large and vividly colored feathers are a key ingredient in helping a Kulu-Ya-Ku's attack females. They'are also useful in marking territory, as it sloughs the, off throughout the regions it frequents. There are also circles of thought that contend these decorative feathers are the remains of ancient wings that the Kulu-Ya-Ku lost through evolution.\r\n- Kulu-Ya-Ku is a cautious monster and is not known to go out of its way to attack others. However, if it feels that it is in danger, Kulu-Ya-Ku will attempt to dig up a boulder for use in battle. The boulder serves not only as a melee or projectile weapon, it also shields the Kulu-Ya-Ku's sensitive head and beak from enemy attacks. Once holding a boulder, the normally reticent Kulu-Ya-Ku may become emboldened and has been known to attack monsters stronger than itself, such as Diablos.\r\n- The sensory organs in its beak can detect minute changes in whatever its beak touches. This is how it easily roots out buried eggs or boulders.\r\n- During mating season, females will lay two eggs per pairing. The male and female each take one egg to parent. This practice reduces the chances of thiers eggs being targeted by natural enemies or competing Kulu-Ya-Ku. What's more, to prevent a Kulu-Ya-Ku from mistakenly preying on its own egg, Kulu-Ya-Ku eggs boast and exceptionally unique coloring compared to other eggs. While brooding their eggs, some Kulu-Ya-Ku may simply fast until their egg hatches. However, albeit rarely, some Kulu-Ya-Ku have been known to succumb to their hunger during fasting and consume the contents of their own egg.\r\n- Kulu-Ya-Ku's main habitat is the Wildspire Waste, which allows them to frequently prey on Aptonoth eggs as well as those of herbivorous and flying wyverns. Occasionally Kulu-Ya-Ku may be spotted in the Ancient Forest, those appearances in the Ancient Forest has often coincided with the mating season of Great Jagras, which considering the substantial distance between regions suggests that the Kulu-Ya-Ku are specifically targeting Great Jagras eggs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

It can be found under Event Quests - this quest can be found under event quests and not as a special investigation in the Gathering Hub. You cannot take on this quest outside of the set times.\r\n\r\n2. Objective: Slay Kulve Taroth - The objective of the quest is to slay Kulve Taroth before it escapes. During this quest, the red icon that appears in the minimap shows if it's enraged or not.\r\n\r\n3. No pursuit Levels or Reward Levels - the quest does not contain pursuit levels or reward levels, so progress does not carry over to the next quest. Any progress made on the Kulve Taroth Siege itself will not be affected by this event quest.\r\n\r\n4. SOS available - During the quest, you can fire SOS flares. MR KT scales with multiplayer, unlike her base game counterpart.\r\n\r\n5. User Materials to Upgrade Appraisal Weapons: Materials obtained are used to upgrade appraisal weapons. While you cannot obtain weapons directly from master rank Kulve Taroth, you use its materials to upgrade any appraisal weapons you already possess.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Tips for MR Kulve Taroth\r\n- Ranged weapons are a lot easier to manage\r\n- Use Thunder element for Gold plated phase, then Ice element afterward\r\n- Use Partbreaker skill\r\n- Bring Wide-Range or group healing items\r\n- Use your clutch claw to weaken the chest during phase 1\r\n- Use your slinger clutch attacks to throw her into walls\r\n- Use `Slinger Capacity` or have another hunter ready to get off a second slam during her idle non-enraged state after an initial slam.\r\n- Weaken chest as first priority upon entering (and arms if possible) then slam; chest break on first slam and arm break on second if weaken.\r\n- Since a large portion of her damage is Fire Based, the Fireproof Mantle is a really good tool to use.\r\n- Avoid trying to block her standing downward punch and leaping body slam because they drain >150 stamina with `Guard` 5. `Lance`'s power guard does not drain stamina on impact and thus should be the only weapon to attempt to guard these moves.\r\n- The gold that falls off of the ceiling after she climbs the center spire cannot blocked, even with `Guard Up`.\r\n- Kulve Taroth's retreat timer will only start to count upon engaging in battle so if you're firing an SOS, it is wise to wait for other hunters before fighting it.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Kulve Taroth Combat Info\r\n- **Kulve Taroth** is weak to `Thunder Element`` `when gold-plated. The weakness swaps to `Ice Element` when the gold-plating is lost.\r\n- The weakest spot is the gold plating on its head unless you are using ammo damage, in which case shoot the forelegs.\r\n- It is only mildly susceptible to all abnormal status effects\r\n- Kinsect Extract: \n  - : head\r\n- : tail/body/chest\r\n- White\r\n \r\n\r\n**For parts**\r\n- `Part Breaker`- Deals 10%, 20%, and 30% more damage for rank 1, 2, and 3 respectively\r\n \r\n\r\n**For faster transporting**\r\n- `Pro Transporter`- Increases movement speed while transporting and reduces downtime on landings.  (Level 1)\r\n- Lets you move cannonballs faster.\r\n \r\n\r\n**For the heat**\r\n- `Cool Drinks`\r\n- `Heat Guard` (same effect as a cool drink, but permanent)\r\n\r\n**For cannons**\r\n- `Heavy Artillery`- Increases the firepower of ballistae and cannons\r\n- Deals 10% and 20%more damage for rank 1, and 2 respectively\r\n \r\n\r\n\\\r\nBreak the horns! Kulve Taroth has four stages. \\\r\nStage one you just need to do enough damage to stop her from retreating, easily done with cannons, falling boulders, and/or attacking her.\\\r\nStage two break 6 pieces of her gold plating. \\\r\nStage three break her gold plating, more easy than stage two if you can get her to sit on the erupting volcanoes and keep her put by using the falling boulders.\\\r\nStage four break her horns! All damage not towards the horns are a waste with the exception of arms(force a trip so you can attack her horns)\\\r\n\\\r\nOther Notes To Keep In Mind\\\r\nHorn Chip Base = 4080\\\r\nHorn Break = 16800\\\r\nThen Pursuit levels 1-6 have multipliers of  200%, 100%, 66.6667, 40%, 33.3333%, and pursuit level 6 with a 25%\\\r\nThis is why as the pursuit level increases it is easier to break her horns.\r\n### Kulve Taroth Weaknesses\r\n### Kulve Taroth Low and High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n\r\n \r\n### Kulve Taroth Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Kulve Taroth Monster.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- The Kulve Taroth's basic design philosophy is based on the Greek myth of the Ram with the golden fleece.\r\n- Kulve Taroth cannot be slain in the siege quest, just repelled. You can only get materials from dropped items, its horns, and the gold that covers them. In master rank however, there is a quest where the objective is to slay her, and there are no pursuit levels or reward levels in that quest, and breaking her horns will not end that quest either.\r\n- Kulve Taroth is known as the \"Glorious Dragon.\"\r\n- \"El Dorado\" Refers to the legendary City/country of Gold the Spanish hoped to find in South America\r\n- It also refers to a different legend, that describes the leader of the Musica, a native American tribe, coat itself in Gold dust to later wa***** of in a lake to honour the gods.\r\n- Both of these legends definitely inspired the Design of Kulve Taroth, as she is fought inside vast caverns filled with gold and coats itself with gold for her own protection.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Wind will burst out from Kushala occasionally; this will stagger you but deal no damage.\r\n- Attacks other monsters: Yes, has turf wars with `Teostra`, `Lunastra`, and `Nergigante.`\r\n- `Small Monsters` version: n/a\r\n- Sizes:  1683.55 ~  2391.41\r\n- Species: `Elder Dragon`\r\n- Kushala is available in Iceborne at MR 19 or higher.\r\n- HP: \n  - High Rank: ~8,039(Solo), ~12,139(Duo), ~18,109(3 or 4 players)\r\n- Master Rank: ~25,472(Solo), ~43,501(Duo), ~64,953(3 or 4 players)\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Kushala Daora Combat Info\r\n- Deals physical damage.\r\n- Weak to `Thunder` and `Dragon`.\r\n- Susceptible to ```Poison` and ```Blast`.\r\n- Weakest in the head, followed by the forelegs and tail. All of them can be broken.\r\n- Similarly to other entries in the series, can be locked into a state of repeated knockdowns by targeting the head with heavy dragon elemental damage.\r\n- Limps and then flies to highest point on Elder's Recess/Ancient Forest.\r\n- Can generate a Wind aura around itself that repels anyone that gets close.\r\n- Wind resistance skills have limited effects. Windproof III can negate the knockback from its normal wind attacks, but not its enraged state.\r\n- Can generate tornados of \"presumed\" air pressure that deal damage to players in the center, and knock players back in the surrounding area.\r\n- The `Hunting Horn` melody *Wind Pressure Negated* can be used to similar effect as described of Windproof III above. The melody *All Wind Pressure Negated* can be used to counter both normal air attacks and those of its enraged mode\r\n- After resting status it will summon numerous tornados.\r\n- Will shoot jets of air at players. Do not underestimate the hitbox, as a full charged is fairly wide.\r\n- Easiest way to defeat is to bring flash pods and 10 flash insects, wait until he flies and flash him, he will fall to the ground and be open.\r\n- **Beware**: Flash Pods shouldn't be used when the Dragon takes off to fly to its nest. Let it go to sleep and set up bombs! Flash pods also won't have any effect when the Dragon is in a tornado.\r\n- Combat in his sleeping area will eventually fill up with tornadoes that impede movement and makes combat much more difficult to position.  Either kill him quickly, or get him to leave the area (through damage or after about 5 minutes of combat).\r\n- Tempered Kushala Daora can only be flashed 4 times.\r\n\r\n \r\n- Flashpods are much less effective, only staggering Kushala instead of Stunning it\r\n- Kushala gains temporary Flash immunity after two Flashes in quick succession\r\n- If you notice that a Tornado has blue crystals inside it, be careful. That thing will move.\r\n- The small roving tornadoes from Kushala Daora's breath attacks will seek out and combine with its larger updraft tornadoes. This causes them to briefly expand and catch inattentive hunters with a heavy blow.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Kushala Daora Weakness\r\n\r\n \r\n### Kushala Daora Low and High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n\r\n \r\n### Kushala Daora Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Kushala Daora Monster.\r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- As of Monster Hunter World, poisoning it does not negate its wind shield. It should be noted the closest replacement to this is to use a weapon with a high Elderseal value.\r\n- Kushala Daora is known as the \"Steel Dragon.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Lunastra heats the air around her enough that cool drinks are required to prevent damage from the air. Her supernova attack has very large range and boasts twice. There is a special bond move where she combines her blast with Teostra to blast three times with a larger range and damage. Use Astera Jerkey after her first nova blast to heal red health on your bar and increase recovery. If Nergigante appears there is a rare turf war that does approximately 2000 damage to Lunastra. Kushala Daora can also have a turf war with her that does approximately 3000 damage to both participants. Use these to your advantage when fighting  her.\r\n- Aim for her wings when she is downed if using a sever damaging weapon which is her highest weak-point for those types of weapons while head for blunt. while standing it is best to use a blunt weapon on her head or ammo on her tail. if using a sever weapon while standing her wings can be struck but for low reaching weapons its best to attack hind legs for the hit zone values there are higher then the rest of her ground level body parts until she is downed.\r\n- Lunastra's high body temperature and dust saps away health unless you use a `Cool Drink,  ``Heat Guard` skill, and/or `Fireproof mantle`. Its dust and blue flame explode when it comes into contact with Fire, so use a bomb or Crystalburst.\r\n- On top of shielding you from Lunastra's heat aura, `Heat Guard` will also protect you from the puddles of fire it puts on the floor, but it will not protect you from `Fireblight`.\r\n- Using `Flash Pods` against Lunastra will not force her to plummet from the sky. It will also cause her to use supernova if she is charged with her aura. However, using Flash Pods don't always cause her to do this, occasionally (and always when mounted) she will flinch or be blinded but not use her ultimate.\r\n### Lunastra Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Lunastra Carves and Rewards\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Lunastra Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Lunastra Monster.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n## Lunastra Armor\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- Paired with Teostra is the first bond special attack\r\n- First monster in Monster Hunter World to use blue flames\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Nergigante will always win, and the elder dragon it was fighting will shortly exit the locale.\r\n- `Small monsters` version: N/A\r\n- Sizes: 1626.35 ~  2310.14\r\n- Species: `Elder Dragon`\r\n- HP: \n  - ~7,110(Solo), ~10,736(Duo), ~16,016(3 or 4 players)\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Nergigante Combat Info\r\n- The key element of fighting Nergigante is keeping an eye on the spikes that periodically grow on its body. These spikes appear on four areas: Wings, Forelegs, Head, and Tail.\\\r\n- When the spikes first grow, they have a yellow/white color and .\r\n- As time passes, the spikes will harden and turn black. After this point, they are no longer a weak spot and may deflect attacks.\r\n- Spiked body parts will do increased damage, and some attacks will be augmented by the spikes. \n    - If Nergigante has grown spikes on its head, it will launch them forward after performing a normal head-slam.\r\n- Occasionally Nergigante will rear back, walk forward, and slam its front leg down. If the leg is spiked, the attack will launch the spikes in all directions.\r\n \r\n- Once Nergigante has grown spikes on its head, wings, and forelegs, it will perform a dive bomb attack. And when the spikes turn into black, it will also launch the spikes upon hitting the ground. \n    - This attack is signaled by Nergigante rearing back on its hind legs and roaring before flying into the air and diving at a player.\r\n- The best method of dealing with this attack is sprinting directly to either side and performing a leaping dodge just before Nergigante begins its dive. Due to this attack's massive area of effect, normal dodges are not sufficient for escaping damage.\r\n- Alternatively, the black spike divebomb attack can be blocked by simply wearing Vitality Mantle in a split second after the roar.\r\n- This attack breaks off Nergigante's spikes and it must begin growing them again.\r\n- Once Nergigante reaches low health and retreats to its lair, it will begin continuously growing spikes, making its dive bomb attack much more frequent.\r\n \r\n \r\n- Keep in mind that, as an Elder Dragon, Nergigante is immune to traps and cannot be captured.\r\n- Breaking Nergigante's horns or severing its tail will reduce the damage of some of its attacks.\r\n- Nergigante is mildly susceptible to all ailments. Using weapons that can stun, paralyze, or cause sleep can buy a few moments to heal/sharpen/buff during the fight.\r\n- Flash Pods can be used to stun it during combos or dive bomb attacks.\r\n- Dragon Pod slinger ammo may occasionally drop from Nergigante, which can be used to disrupt attacks and has a chance to stagger.\r\n- Weakness sign: Limping\r\n- Bowgun users should aim for the head, arms and wings, preferably those with white spikes. Thunder and pierce ammo work well, along with poison and paralysis shots. Nergigante moves quickly but several long animations and predictable movements may give enough time for cluster shots or wyvern ammo.\r\n- Nergigante's nest (Area 15) is particularly dangerous due to the cramped quarters and environmental hazards: \n  - Crystal shards can drop from above during the fight; these can stagger players and interrupt attacks or dodges. Look around for areas with crystal spikes lodged into the ground; these should be avoided if possible.\r\n- There are two walls, one east one south, that Nergigante may break with a dive bomb. This should give a little more room to work and behind the southern wall are several flash flies that may be of use.\r\n \r\n- Nergigante will run between areas 8, 9 and 14 and will retreat to area 15 to rest.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Nergigante High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n\r\n \r\n### Nergigante Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Nergigante Monster.\r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n### Gallery, Notes & Trivia\r\n- Unlike Nergigante's spikes, its horns will not grow back if they are broken.\r\n- A unique victory theme plays upon defeating Nergigante for the first time.\r\n- Nergigante is known as the \"Extinction Dragon\"\r\n- In the Jyuratodus cutscene, a Barroth corpse can be seen with some spikes, persumably killed by Nergigante.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

They're very perceptive and quick to spot intruders, and they adjust their attitude to meet the threat at hand, If they consider their opponent to be weak, Pukei-Pukei stand their ground and unleash a merciless spray of poison. On the other hand, if that intruder happens to be a rathalos or another monster beyond their level of strength, they may panic and eventually flee. Having the ability to determine the difference between an intruder's strength and its own allows the Pukei-Pukei to run away and hopefully live to see another day. Some might call this cowardice, but at root of such display might be wisdom.\r\n- The Pukei-Pukei's natural camouflage is well suited to its forest home. However, in the event that something in its surroundings changes, the Pukei-Pukei's plumage will change colors. The Pukei-Pukei's plumage is covered in fine crystalline particles also changes, making it appear as if the Pukei-Pukei's plumage has suddenly changed. If, for example, a Pukei-Pukei were to be attacked by a weaker monster, it might change its feathers to a bright red to convey its aggressiveness. If a Pukei-Pukei were to be attacked by a monster it recognized as stronger than itself, it might tuck in its body and fold in its feathers, turning them a cream-like color.\r\n- The secret of Pukei-Pukei's astounding perception lies in its unusually large and spherical eyes. According to one scholar, a study of the Pukei-Pukei's eyes revealed that compared to the eyes of other creatures, their eyes contain a strikingly large number of color-receptor cells. These superb photoreceptors are capable of differentiating between many variant of red, blue, green, violet, and yellow. With its oblong pupils that control the amount of light allowed into its eyes, Pukei-Pukei can even distinguish between colors in the dark. The uncanny ability to discern colors allows Pukei-Pukei to recognize threatening monsters in an instant and vacate dangerous areas in the blink of an eye.\r\n- Pukei-Pukei feeds mainly on plants like Poisoncups and stores these foods in its chin and tail. In conflict, it will mix these with the contents of its poison-producing sacs and release combination of the materials from its mouth. Depending on which plants are mixed, the Pukei-Pukei can create a variety of toxins. A sporepuff base will create a mist-like spray, while the Scatternuts make a poison bubble that bursts and spreads on contact. Furthermore, when these plant and poison mixtures are given time to ferment, they create a highly volatile poison vapor. When this vapor combines with the fluid of the Pukei-Pukei's poison sacs, it forms a very powerful poison gas. The Pukei-Pukei stores this gas in its highly elastic tail and will release it as a last resort when facing strong opponents. The plants that it feeds on are not only for sustenance, but also for self defense.\r\n- A Pukei-Pukei's tongue is highly elastic, comparable to that of its tail. Near the centre of its tongue is a specialized bone called the \"hyoid\". When this bone is pushed forward, it pulls the surrounding muscle along with it and extends. Research shows that a Pukei-Pukei's tongue can stretch beyond four meters long. The tongue's elasticity is so powerful that a single human's strength is insufficient to stretch the tongue by force; only the Pukei-Pukei's well developed hyoid and surrounding muscles allow it to stretch its tongue at will. Through clever use of its tongue, Pukei-Pukei can easily grasp food(such as high-growing Scatternuts while airborne) or thwart invaders from a significant distance.\r\n- Pukei-Pukei is somewhat of a rarity when it comes to reproductive habits since it utilizes Mernos nests for brood parasitism. During breeding season, a Pukei-Pukei waits for a small window when a Mernos has vacated its nest and proceeds to deposit its ovum among the Mernos's eggs. The Pukei-Pukei chick then hatches before the Mernos's young do, at which time it instinctually pushes the other eggs out of the nest. This ensures that only Pukei-Pukei chick receives the care that the Mernos unwittingly  provides for it. A young Pukei-Pukei leaves the nest, learns to fly of its own accord, and naturally seeks out vegetation for sustenance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

After some time he will take to the skies and release an explosion. The explosion covers a great distance so run away once he begins to fly up or utilize a `flash pod` to knock him to the ground. You can also utilize `crystalburst` to interrupt his supernova.\r\n- In instances where the Teostra and Lunastra are both spawned, hunters should try to keep them apart.

Moving about the forest this way is beneficial to Tobi-Kadachi, as rubbing its body against trees allows it to build up static electricity in its fur. The monster's physical prowess and acrobatic skill make it possible to live a lifestyle that would make otherwise be very difficult in a dense forest habitat. Its speed and agility are unmatched by any monster in the Ancient Forest.\r\n- A master tree climber like Tobi-Kadachi is made even more stealthy thanks to the gliding webbing located between its fore and hind legs. When moving about or hunting prey, the webbing masks the sound of its movements, letting it dart silently along the very edges of its prey's vision before moving in for the kill.\r\n- Tobi-Kadachi accumulates static electricity by rubbing its fur coat against trees. When in conflict with an enemy, if the Tobi-Kadachi is excited it will ruffle its coat and release this charge throughout its body. In this charged state, the Tobi-Kadachi is capable of adding devastating electrical charges to its biting and tail attacks. Some have even suggested that these electrical impulses nay enhance its physical capabilities. While we know much about Tobi-Kadachi's hunting habits, reports of its eating habits are scarce. We believe this might be because Tobi-Kadachi is highly energy efficient and in addition to having a low metabolism, may be able to spend several days without feeding.\r\n- Tobi-Kadachi's means of storing electricity comes from the countless needlelike electrodes dotting its fur. Usually hidden from view, these electrodes store up static electricity generated by Tobi-Kadachi's movements. When a certain amount of electricity is accumulated, Tobi-Kadachi's hair will stand on end, exposing the electrodes. The electricity arcing between them wraps the monster's entire body in a flickering pale-blue light. When attacking, Tobi-Kadachi presses these needles against its victim to electrocute them. These external electric shocks interfere with the victim's biological electric signals and often cause them to lose consciousness.\r\n- A Tobi-Kadachi's tail is equal in length to and sometimes longer than its main body. It goes without saying that a larger tail means more surface area, which in turns gives the monster greater potential for electrical buildup and achieving its charged taste faster. Simply put, the stronger a Tobi-Kadachi is, the more well developed its tail will be. The scalesseen along the Tobi-Kadachi's back down to end of its tail are not unlike the tail feathers of a bird, and they becomes softer as they reach the end of the tail, allowing greater flexibility and static buildup.\r\n- We don't have much information on their breeding habits, but we do know that they lead mainly solitary lives without forming social groups. Even though coupling behavior or juvenile Tobi-Kadachi have not been witnessed, it's been hypothesized that the size of a male Tobi-Kadachi's tail is directly proportional to its strength and plays a role in attracting a mate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

At a certain amount of damage, it starts playing dead to collect Miasma for a powerful attack.\r\n- Combat tactics: Due to its ability to shorten your Healthbar, a meal to get your Health up to 150, Vitality gems for up to 50 more HP, and a couple of Max Potions and Nutrients would be best to take on a hunt if you want to slay this Elder Dragon. \n  - Nulberries can get rid of the Effect of Miasma.\r\n- The above mentioned \"playing dead\" should be approached from behind, since after collecting enough Miasma, it will shoot out a beam in front of itself, which can sometimes be fatal.This attack can be prevented by doing enough damage to it before it can collect enough Miasma. This attack can be stopped with a flash pod.\r\n- Equipping 3 Miasma gems will completely negate its ability to reduce your health to half. You'll still take damage, but your health bar will remain intact.\r\n- In the area just outside its den, on the ceiling are two fangs suspended by vines; hitting them with a projectile will cause them to fall down. Hitting Vaal Hazak with these does a decent amount of damage, and also knocks it over.\r\n- Multiplayer sessions should be wary of its Miasma beam. If it detects a target far enough away from it, it may decide to use this attack. Given the beam's large area of effect and distance, it's very possible that unwary hunters may be caught up in the beam by coincidence. \n    - This can also be triggered by your Palico or nearby monsters such as the Raphinos that appear just outside its lair and the Girros within, even though he is not hostile to them.\r\n- In certain areas the beam can be blocked by the locale, such as a boulder or a wall\r\n \r\n- Stay away from acid pools, as the combination of acid damage and Miasma damage drains health very quickly.\r\n \r\n- Resistances: The Vaal Hazak is Immune to `Water` and has a relative high resistance to Poison, Sleep and Paralysis with only 1⭐\r\n- Vaal Hazak's `Dragon  `weakness only applies to wounded body parts while its `Fire` weakness is always active.\r\n- The general tactics against Vaal Hazak is staying on its two sides (since it only has one breath ability that can attack sideways), maintaining a relatively close distance (since it has long distance reposition abilities that can put you in a position where it is impossible to be out of the line of fire of its breath), and keeping in mind that its charge abilities are (somewhat) wide and long.\r\n### Vaal Hazak Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Vaal Hazak High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n\r\n \r\n### Vaal Hazak Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Vaal Hazak Monster.\r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- While Vaal Hazak has a branch in 10 weapon trees, only 4 of them (Greatsword, Lance, Light Bowgun, and Hammer) have a unique end of upgrade model as a Rarity 8 weapon. The other 6 (Long Sword, Gunlance, Switch Axe, Charge Blade, Insect Glaive, and Bow) end their upgrade path at Rarity 7, retaining the basic Bone weapon model with additional Vaal Hazak trimming, taking the form of a plate of green scales with several hook-like fangs tied to it and wrapped in a piece of red cloth.\r\n- These monsters are from the Elder Dragon species\r\n- These monsters are 2011.58 - 2619.25  big\r\n- Can be lured with ??\r\n- Camouflage works until ?? range\r\n- Vaal Hazak is known as the \"Corpse Coat Dragon\"\r\n- Tempered Vaal Hazak health is 10000\r\n\r\n\\\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

As soon as it is in rage mode, its stomp becomes lethal once up close, since it adds an explosion after the initial stomp. Usually, when it isn't raging, the stomp is a good time to damage its feet, although its best to stay away from its front feet when it is in rage mode since anyone fighting with a close-range weapon will take heavy damage. \r\n- Xeno'jiva will fire three kinds of projectiles while grounded. The first will be three projectiles first firing middle then 45 degrees to the right then 45 degrees from center to the left. Its second is a 180-degree beam that is fired from its mouth covering the entire distance of the map. The third is just a straight beam that is fired directly in front of it (This is a very good time to do heavy damage near the side of its face and claws.)\r\n- The first area contains crystal formations on the ceiling which can be shot with slinger ammo and dropped on Xeno'jiva for extra damage.\r\n- When Xeno'jiiva takes to the sky, it is best to shoot it down quickly with any slinger ammo you find ( they drop on the ground). Xeno'jiiva can perform long-range projectile attacks and a diving claw attack that causes dragon explosions in its wake. \r\n- Resistances: Xeno'jiva can't be put to `Sleep` and resists `Stun` and `Paralysis` pretty well. `Flash Pods` are also ineffective.\r\n- The head and tail are the weakest areas, followed by the chest. All of them can be broken.\r\n- Xeno'jiva is the only Elder Dragon apart from `Zorah Magdaros` that *cannot* be mounted.\r\n- Xeno'jiva beams will heat up the ground beneath it. A way to combat this is with `Uragaan` armour, the `Heat Guard` skill, or the `Fireproof Mantle`, as they will protect you from `Fireblight`.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Xeno'jiiva Weaknesses\r\n### Xeno'jiiva High-Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Xeno'jiiva Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmour and Weapons related to the Xeno'jiiva Monster.\r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- Can't be lured\r\n- Camouflage works until ?? range\r\n- Xeno'jiiva is known as the \"Dark Light Dragon\"\r\n- Xeno'jiiva has been nicknamed by the community as the \"Sapphire Star,\" as it is strongly implied that it arrived to the new world via the same meteor mentioned in The Tale of the Five. \n  - The meteor in that story is seen as a symbol of hope (hence, \"may the Sapphire Star guide your way\"). This is ironic, since nobody knew it contained an extremely powerful and dangerous dragon (that is, until the player fights it themself).\r\n \r\n- Xeno'jiiva's name has Greek, Hindu and Jain origins. \n  - \"Xeno\" is Greek for \"Alien\". \n    - It is implied that Xeno'jiiva came from another world via the Sapphire Star meteor, and its biology is described as \"alien\" by researchers.\r\n \r\n- In Hinduism and Jainism, a \"jiva\" (Sanskrit: जीव, jīva, alternative spelling jiwa; Hindi: जीव, jīv, alternative spelling jeev) is a living being, or any entity imbued with a life force. \n    - Likewise, Xeno'jiiva developed from the life energy of dying elder dragons.\r\n \r\n- In Jainism, \"jiva\" is the immortal essence or soul of a living organism (human, animal, plant, etc.) which survives physical death. \n    - This could explain why Xeno'jiiva comes back to life after being slain, so that the player can hunt it again. \n      - A far more likely explanation is that being able to rehunt it is simply a game mechanic, like Behemoth and Leshen, and nearly every Elder Dragon in previous installments.\r\n \r\n- It is theorized by fans that if Xeno'jiiva was left to incubate, it could become an unstoppable, godlike being.  \n      - This concept is finally realized with the reveal of Safi'jiiva.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Its miasma will deal damage to you if you get too close, though.\r\n- Attacks other monsters: Yes\r\n- Sizes:  1843.95 ~  2619.25\r\n- Species: `Elder Dragon`\r\n- Health: ~9,494(Solo), ~14,335(Duo), ~21,385(3 or 4 players)\r\n\r\n \r\n### Vaal Hazak Combat Info\r\n- Elemental damages: Vaal Hazak emits a fatal vapor, also called \"Effluvium\", which it uses to hurt its enemies.\r\n- Weaknesses: Vaal Hazak is weak to `Fire` and `Dragon `.`\\\r\n`\r\n- Moderately susceptible to ``Blastblight and ``Stun.\r\n- Weapons with Elderseal cause its Miasma to dissipate for a short time.\r\n- Head, chest, front legs and tail are weakspots.\r\n- Weakness signs: As soon as the Vaal Hazak is injured enough, it starts limping. At a certain amount of damage, it starts playing dead to collect Miasma for a powerful attack.\r\n- Combat tactics: Due to its ability to shorten your Healthbar, a meal to get your Health up to 150, Vitality gems for up to 50 more HP, and a couple of Max Potions and Nutrients would be best to take on a hunt if you want to slay this Elder Dragon. \n  - Nulberries can get rid of the Effect of Miasma.\r\n- The above mentioned \"playing dead\" should be approached from behind, since after collecting enough Miasma, it will shoot out a beam in front of itself, which can sometimes be fatal.This attack can be prevented by doing enough damage to it before it can collect enough Miasma. This attack can be stopped with a flash pod.\r\n- Equipping 3 Miasma gems will completely negate its ability to reduce your health to half. You'll still take damage, but your health bar will remain intact.\r\n- In the area just outside its den, on the ceiling are two fangs suspended by vines; hitting them with a projectile will cause them to fall down. Hitting Vaal Hazak with these does a decent amount of damage, and also knocks it over.\r\n- Multiplayer sessions should be wary of its Miasma beam. If it detects a target far enough away from it, it may decide to use this attack. Given the beam's large area of effect and distance, it's very possible that unwary hunters may be caught up in the beam by coincidence. \n    - This can also be triggered by your Palico or nearby monsters such as the Raphinos that appear just outside its lair and the Girros within, even though he is not hostile to them.\r\n- In certain areas the beam can be blocked by the locale, such as a boulder or a wall\r\n \r\n- Stay away from acid pools, as the combination of acid damage and Miasma damage drains health very quickly.\r\n \r\n- Resistances: The Vaal Hazak is Immune to `Water` and has a relative high resistance to Poison, Sleep and Paralysis with only 1⭐\r\n- Vaal Hazak's `Dragon  `weakness only applies to wounded body parts while its `Fire` weakness is always active.\r\n- The general tactics against Vaal Hazak is staying on its two sides (since it only has one breath ability that can attack sideways), maintaining a relatively close distance (since it has long distance reposition abilities that can put you in a position where it is impossible to be out of the line of fire of its breath), and keeping in mind that its charge abilities are (somewhat) wide and long.\r\n### Vaal Hazak Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Vaal Hazak High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n\r\n \r\n### Vaal Hazak Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Vaal Hazak Monster.\r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- While Vaal Hazak has a branch in 10 weapon trees, only 4 of them (Greatsword, Lance, Light Bowgun, and Hammer) have a unique end of upgrade model as a Rarity 8 weapon. The other 6 (Long Sword, Gunlance, Switch Axe, Charge Blade, Insect Glaive, and Bow) end their upgrade path at Rarity 7, retaining the basic Bone weapon model with additional Vaal Hazak trimming, taking the form of a plate of green scales with several hook-like fangs tied to it and wrapped in a piece of red cloth.\r\n- These monsters are from the Elder Dragon species\r\n- These monsters are 2011.58 - 2619.25  big\r\n- Can be lured with ??\r\n- Camouflage works until ?? range\r\n- Vaal Hazak is known as the \"Corpse Coat Dragon\"\r\n- Tempered Vaal Hazak health is 10000\r\n\r\n\\\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

It is the juvenile form of `Safi'jiiva`.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Xeno'jiiva Details & Locations\r\n- Found in: `Elder's Recess`\r\n- A target of Quest: `Land of Convergence`, `A Light Upon the River's Gloom`, `Keeper of the Otherworld`, `Like a Moth to the Flame`\r\n- Is immediately hostile at medium to long range\r\n- Attacks other monsters: (No other monsters in Xeno'jiiva's arena)\r\n- `Small Monsters` version: N/A\r\n- Sizes: 4509.10 ~ 4509.10\r\n- Species: `Elder Dragon`\r\n- HP: ~15,150(Solo), ~22,875(Duo), ~34,125(3 or 4 players) \n  - Arch Tempered: ~25,500(Solo), ~44,400(Duo), ~66,300(3 or 4 players)\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Xeno'jiiva Combat Info\r\n- Xeno'jiiva's Element Weakness is the same against every type of Element (`Fire`, `Water`, `Thunder`, `Ice`, and `Dragon`), ⭐⭐ each.\r\n- Weaknesses: Xeno'jiiva is very weak to ```Poison` with ⭐⭐⭐.\r\n- Combat tactics: Be very careful. As soon as it is in rage mode, its stomp becomes lethal once up close, since it adds an explosion after the initial stomp. Usually, when it isn't raging, the stomp is a good time to damage its feet, although its best to stay away from its front feet when it is in rage mode since anyone fighting with a close-range weapon will take heavy damage. \r\n- Xeno'jiva will fire three kinds of projectiles while grounded. The first will be three projectiles first firing middle then 45 degrees to the right then 45 degrees from center to the left. Its second is a 180-degree beam that is fired from its mouth covering the entire distance of the map. The third is just a straight beam that is fired directly in front of it (This is a very good time to do heavy damage near the side of its face and claws.)\r\n- The first area contains crystal formations on the ceiling which can be shot with slinger ammo and dropped on Xeno'jiva for extra damage.\r\n- When Xeno'jiiva takes to the sky, it is best to shoot it down quickly with any slinger ammo you find ( they drop on the ground). Xeno'jiiva can perform long-range projectile attacks and a diving claw attack that causes dragon explosions in its wake. \r\n- Resistances: Xeno'jiva can't be put to `Sleep` and resists `Stun` and `Paralysis` pretty well. `Flash Pods` are also ineffective.\r\n- The head and tail are the weakest areas, followed by the chest. All of them can be broken.\r\n- Xeno'jiva is the only Elder Dragon apart from `Zorah Magdaros` that *cannot* be mounted.\r\n- Xeno'jiva beams will heat up the ground beneath it. A way to combat this is with `Uragaan` armour, the `Heat Guard` skill, or the `Fireproof Mantle`, as they will protect you from `Fireblight`.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Xeno'jiiva Weaknesses\r\n### Xeno'jiiva High-Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Xeno'jiiva Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmour and Weapons related to the Xeno'jiiva Monster.\r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- Can't be lured\r\n- Camouflage works until ?? range\r\n- Xeno'jiiva is known as the \"Dark Light Dragon\"\r\n- Xeno'jiiva has been nicknamed by the community as the \"Sapphire Star,\" as it is strongly implied that it arrived to the new world via the same meteor mentioned in The Tale of the Five. \n  - The meteor in that story is seen as a symbol of hope (hence, \"may the Sapphire Star guide your way\"). This is ironic, since nobody knew it contained an extremely powerful and dangerous dragon (that is, until the player fights it themself).\r\n \r\n- Xeno'jiiva's name has Greek, Hindu and Jain origins. \n  - \"Xeno\" is Greek for \"Alien\". \n    - It is implied that Xeno'jiiva came from another world via the Sapphire Star meteor, and its biology is described as \"alien\" by researchers.\r\n \r\n- In Hinduism and Jainism, a \"jiva\" (Sanskrit: जीव, jīva, alternative spelling jiwa; Hindi: जीव, jīv, alternative spelling jeev) is a living being, or any entity imbued with a life force. \n    - Likewise, Xeno'jiiva developed from the life energy of dying elder dragons.\r\n \r\n- In Jainism, \"jiva\" is the immortal essence or soul of a living organism (human, animal, plant, etc.) which survives physical death. \n    - This could explain why Xeno'jiiva comes back to life after being slain, so that the player can hunt it again. \n      - A far more likely explanation is that being able to rehunt it is simply a game mechanic, like Behemoth and Leshen, and nearly every Elder Dragon in previous installments.\r\n \r\n- It is theorized by fans that if Xeno'jiiva was left to incubate, it could become an unstoppable, godlike being.  \n      - This concept is finally realized with the reveal of Safi'jiiva.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

It can also use wood magic to summon roots to attack or \"defend\".\r\n- This monster can inflict `Bleeding`\r\n- This monster is weak to `Fire (⭐``⭐``⭐), ``Dragon` (⭐⭐) and`Thunder` (⭐⭐)\r\n- Player can break the Ancient Leshen's Antlers, Body and Legs.\r\n- This monster is resistant to `Water` and `Sleep`\r\n- Kinsect Extract: \n  - : Head/Antlers\r\n- : Waist/Body\r\n- : Legs\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Ancient Leshen Guide\r\n\r\nThis quest’s difficulty will be on par with Extreme Behemoth. While it is possible to solo, Ancient Leshen’s large health pool and summoning mechanics will make it extremely difficult. Gather some friends or find a lobby that is hosting this quest to easily find other players as SOS were little to none during the time tested.\r\n\r\nUpon arrival quickly open your map and fly to Camp 11 in the Northeast as the Ancient Leshen starts in Quadrant 12. Pick up the Redpit slinger thats on the slope near camp. Jump across the gap, swing from the vine, and head down the root to be outside of the Leshen’s first area. Hopefully, one member of the team have wide range to share their buffs with the whole team. These buffs include:\r\n- Mega Demondrug\r\n- Mega Armorskin\r\n- Demon Powder\r\n- Hardshell Powder\r\n- Attack Seeds\r\n- Defense Seeds\r\n\r\nEnter Quadrant 12 by crawling under the tree vine and have 1 member turn left, look up and shoot down the boulder onto the Leshen. Doing this deals 3375 damage to the Leshen and 480 to the surrounding Jagras. Another member should run up to the Leshen and drop their Health Booster. Other team members should dawn their Temporal Mantle and go to town. Temporal Mantle will negate heavy damage but the chip damage taken from the Leshen’s crow aura will bypass it thus needing the Health Booster on the ground to counter it. I usually refrain from popping my Temporal until a minute goes by so not all Temporal Mantles will be on cool down at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe Leshen fights similarly as the one everyone had to fight in Contract: Trouble in the Ancient Forest. His primary attacking are summoning roots to attack the player. The offensive version will travel in a linear V-shaped path while the defensive version will summon a wall of roots around the Leshen which will spread outward 3 times.If players get too close he will swing his arms punching the player away. He also have a root attack that will come up from the ground at the feet of a random player. This attack has a long range on where it can spawn and it has a moderate range from which it extends to. He can send out his murder of crows to attack the player in succession.\r\n\r\nThe deadly attack to watch out for is a CC type move from the Leshen which he will imprison a player with roots. The crows will deal damage over time as well as the Leshen may attack the player or summon his pack of Jagras until the Leshen will shoot a bursting root at the player. This attack is lethal as a 200 HP character with good defense will barely survive it let alone if they were already weak or was attack by other beings once caught. Luckily your teammates can save you if you are caught. Use the `Hunter Runestone` or Igni to set the roots aflame. Alternatively, players may also flash the Leshen which will break the hold.\r\n\r\nThe Leshen likes to teleport around the area, so using the slinger and shooting him will stagger him at times allowing your teammates to continue their onslaught. There are scatternuts, redpits, puddle pods, and the Leshen will drop dragon and piercing pods that all can be used.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ancient Leshen summons his Jagras pack make sure to eliminate them as quick as possible. These Jagras are tanky and are highly annoying due to the vast number of them while the Leshen will enclose players in a root prison while distracted. Players that have long weapons like a longsword should focus them down to allow the other teammates to focus on the Ancient Leshen. If overrun use flash pods to temporarily stun the Leshen and all the Jagras.\r\n\r\nAt times the Ancient Leshen will cause a large rumble and explode scattering tons of crows throughout the map. This attack hits very hard so it’s not wise to try to tank it. This attack is similar to Teostra’s fire AOE which they charge up then explodes. A flash pod will be able to counter this attack or simply use your superman dive to safely avoid it. This attack may occur up to 4 times during this quest.\r\n\r\nThe Leshen has 2 different paths he may take during this quest.\r\n- Path 1 is Quadrant 12, 8, 7, finally 6.\r\n- Path 2 is Quadrant 12, 5, 4, finally 2.\r\n- Hitting the Leshen with the boulder in Quadrant 12 is a must!\r\n- Bring Temporal Mantles and Health Boosters\r\n- Health Augment on your weapon can counter the chip damage from the Leshen’s crow aura.\r\n- Having 1 player healing the team will improve success rate.\r\n- If players have weapons that helps them mount, take advantage of it.\r\n- Ancient Leshen is 3 star weak to fire, 2 star weak to dragon and thunder\r\n- Poison is the ailment he is weakest to.\r\n- Paralyze can allow players extra time to attack.\r\n-  Bring Flash Pods\r\n- Bring your igni!

It can also use wood magic to summon roots to attack or \"defend\".\r\n- This monster can inflict `Bleeding`\r\n- This monster is weak to the Igni Sign, as well as `Fire (⭐``⭐``⭐), ``Dragon` (⭐⭐) and`Thunder` (⭐⭐)\r\n- This monster can be staggered with the `Hunter Runestone`\r\n- Geralt can break the Leshen's Antlers, Body and Legs.\r\n- Combat tactics\r\n- This monster is resistant to `Water` and `Sleep`\r\n- Kinsect Extract: \n  - : Head/Antlers\r\n- : Waist/Body\r\n- : Legs\r\n \r\n- The Igni Sign can be used to instantly kill the Jagras the Leshen summons. This is especially useful to keep a certain ally alive.\r\n- Dispell the cloud of Revoltures with the Igni Sign\r\n- You can actually mount the Leshen. The animation is weird and it has only one spot you grab onto, but it works nonetheless. Brace whenever it tries to shake you off and you will get a free knockdown.\r\n- Break the Leshens antlers twice to stop it from summoning Jagras. Easier said than done however. Mounting the Leshen will help.\r\n- **SPOILERS!**- While completing the \"Investigation\" that leads up to the fight, you will come across a Pukei-Pukei hanging dead in some roots. Head right to continue the quest, but if you head left, you will find another Pukei-Pukei, choked by roots. From there you should see a third Pukei-Pukei, barely alive and quite beaten up. Burn the Roots with Igni and it will fly away for now. It will later join Geralt towards the end of the Leshen fight. \n    - Pukei will Poison the Leshen at least twice for some great Damage. It will also deal low physical damage\r\n- The biggest danger to Pukei are the Jagras. Make sure to deal with them as quickly as possible.\r\n \r\n- Keep Pukei alive with Dust of Life (make sure to grab the EZ Dust of Life from the chest at a base camp) and you will get a special reward at the end (Plus, it's just really heartwarming).\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n### Leshen Weaknesses\r\n\r\n \r\n### Leshen High Rank Carves\r\n\r\nDefeating this monster allows the player to carve the following items:\r\n### LeshenWeapons & Armor\r\n\r\nArmor and Weapons related to the Leshen Monster. \r\n## \r\n- `Witcher's Silver Sword`\r\n- `Witcher's Silver Sword +`\r\n## \r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes & Trivia\r\n- Can be lured with ??\r\n- Camouflage works until ?? range\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Once enough doodles have been collected open your map and find a tailrider icon with a description of ???. Mark it and follow your scout flies to it where you'll find a lone Bugtrapper that will run. Chase it back to its camp (near Camp 17). Once you arrive at its camp your Palico will talk to it and befriend it asking to join the Bugtrappers.\r\n- Flashfly Cage - A Bugtrapper insect cage used to stop monsters in their tracks.

Follow your scout flies to an area near (Camp 15), there you'll find a  lone Protector worried about his friends after they got separated by a Barroth. He'll ask you to find them and capture them with your capture net. Your Palico will then mark their locations on your map. Go to each and attempt to capture them ( Ghillie Mantle has no effect on them meaning they will still run if you approach with your Ghillie Mantle equipped? [Unverified] ), they will be scanning the area so approach when they aren't looking and capture them. Once all three have been captured, return to the first Protector and he'll befriend you.\r\n- Shieldspire - A massive Protector shield used to defend against attacks. It can also be used to provoke monsters, drawing their attention. Guard effectiveness increase with Proficiency.

Find the Troupers in Area 10, they will be riding Shamos and attack, defeat them and they will run, follow them to their hideout where they will explain they were planning on hunting two Tzitzi-Ya-Ku's that have been causing trouble. Your Palico will offer to help and you'll receive an Optional Quest to complete which involves defeating two Tzitzi-Ya-Ku's. (You do not have to wait for a Lynian Researcher to be present in the area.)\r\n- Coral Orchestra - An instrument of Trouper make, able to yield a variety of effects.

Find a Plunderer in Area 13, it only appears after the Odogaron has dragged over the Legian corpse from Area 9. Then chase it with scout flies to the dead end in Area 15. Put out Raw Meat when told to by your Palico. After a few moments multiple Plunderers will come to eat the meat. You will get the usual cut scene before they join you. (You do not have to wait for a Lynian Researcher to be present in the area.)\r\n- Plunderblade - An invention on the Plunderers that snatches items from monsters when attacking. The quantity of stolen items increases with proficiency. (In-Game Description)\\\r\n- Max Proficiency Reward - Palarang\r\n \r\n- Ability to befriend Girros and make them tailraiders.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo start this quest you must have befriended all the other Grymalkynes. Speak to the Lynian Researcher in Astera by the Ecological Research area. This will give you a new Critical Bounty called Gajalaka Exchange: Gajalaka Linguistics in which you must find 10 Gajalaka Tracks. These appear as Gajalaka Doodles and only in high rank zones. Each locale (Not necessarily each zone) has at least 2 doodles, some may have more. Doodles appear relatively close to where Gajalaka spawn (filter your map by \"small monsters\" to locate them). Doodles do not respawn, not even if you go back to Astera and return.\r\n- Ancient Forest - Areas 5, 15\r\n- Wildspire Wastes - Areas 3, 5, 7\r\n- Coral Highlands - Area 12, 6 (found at the Bottom of area 6)\r\n- Rotten Vale - Area 3 (2 doodles), 15 (you can find 3 doodles here without Gajalaka)\r\n- Elder's Recess - Area 8\r\n\r\nAfter you turn in the Bounty you must speak with the Lynian Researcher again to get Gajalaka Exchange: Gajalaka Linguistics II. Equip your Ghillie Mantle to make this one easier then return to the Elder's Recess AT NIGHT. You can wait for night, or simply go into your tent within one of your camps (where you can change Palico and your own gear and heal up, your character literally drinks tea there) to trigger the change. When you arrive the Lynian Researcher will be at the entrance of the Gajalaka Camp. From there sneak into the camp without being seen. The Ghillie Mantle will make you invisible. When you get close enough to the fire without being noticed the camera will zoom in on a hole in the wall, interact with the hole without being seen to complete the quest. (Note: \"Wild\" Gajalaka will remain hostile in all zones, ally Gajalaka will be marked with green indicators like other tailraiders.)\r\n- Meowlotov Cocktail - Throws a Gajalaka-style bomb that deals damage.

Speak to him and he'll tell you that in order to gain the Boaboa's favor, you must impress them. To do so, you must successfully hunt a large monster in front of the Boaboa scouts, to which they will aid you.  Next, your Palico will tell you that the Boaboa wish to speak with you.  Travel down the path away from campsite 1, just until you crawl under the large branch.  A group of Boaboa will ask you to meet them at their lair.  Head to area 2 and take the wingdrake.  Climb up the waterfall rocks and through the corridor at the northeast corner to their lair.  Speak to the Boaboa within the lair, they will offer you the quest By Our Powers Combined.  Accept the quest and hunt the tempered Beotodus.\r\n- Tailraider Signal - A signal to call a Grimalkyne to your aid.\r\n- Max Proficiency Reward - [Unknown]\r\n- Purple Boaboa's will no longer attack you\r\n- A shortcut to area 17 (upon reaching level six Unity)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

        "mainContent": "\r\n**Gajalaka** is a `Small Monster` in **Monster Hunter World (MHW)**. ガジャブー in Japanese.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis Lynian discovered in the New World is small, but unlike Felynes and Grimalkynes, Galajakas have a humanlike physique. Their language is unique and analysis of their traces is needed to establish communication. Their culture enjoys dancing but is still warlike. Except for a few friendly people, anyone who approaches them is considered a target for elimination. Lynians who wear similar masks exist in the Old World too, and they are generally referred to as Galajakas.\r\n\r\nThe Galajakas scattered around each location are often hostile. This is because, much like the Grimalkynes, several tribes exist among them, and the hunter will not have interacted with all of them. Their attacks induce small abnormal status effects, and though they are very small, the Galajakas are very dangerous. Common knowledge says the that driving them away with Flash Pods and Scatternutes is best.\r\n### Gajalaka Details & Locations\r\n- Found in: `Ancient Forest`, `Wildspire Waste`, `Coral Highlands`, `Rotten Vale`, `Elder's Recess`, Caverns of El Dorado\r\n- They only appear in High Rank expedition and quests.\r\n- Target of Quest:`Chef Quest! Gajalaka Lockdown`\r\n- Is immediately hostile at close range.\r\n- `Intimidator` Rank 3 skill prevents them from engaging you in battle.\r\n- Attacks other monsters: Yes\r\n- `Large Monsters` version: No\r\n- Sizes: Same as `Palicoes`\r\n- Species: Lynian\r\n\r\n \r\n### Gajalaka Combat Info\r\n- Gajalakas are overall weak enemies and usually stand still most of the time but they move extremely fast and due to their small size can easily be missed by hunters' melee attacks and prove to be a reasonably difficult target for ranged weapons. Their offensive consists in the usage of bombs, poisoned throwing knives and paralyzing throwing knives, but at melee range they will resort to stabbing with a poison blade. Gajalaka molotov bombs will do a considerable amount of damage and knock the player into the air, although they can be easily dodged because of their slow speed and the preparation time it takes for a Gajalaka to throw one.\r\n- They also spawn in groups of 3 or 4 \r\n- They always drop supply items.\r\n- They use poison and paralysis ailments.\r\n- Gajalakas can be fought just like any other small monster. Pay attention to their molotov bombs attacks and try to not let them go in range to use their throwing knives, as their ailments can be pretty annoying.\r\n- Resistances: N/A\r\n\r\n \r\n### Gajalaka Drops\r\n\r\nDefeating Gajalakas will cause them to burrow underground and escape, dropping one of the following items behind:\r\n- Poison Knife (Supply)\r\n- Sleep Knife (Supply)\r\n- First-aid Med\r\n- Paralysis Knife (Supply)\r\n- EZ Ration\r\n\r\nNote that *all* drops from Gajalakas are `Supply Items`, so they will be removed from the Item Pouch upon returning from the field.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Gajalaka Weapons & Armor\r\n\r\nGajalakas cannot be carved for materials (since killing them just makes them go away). However, they do have a related Palico equipment that can be crafted after completing the quest Chef Quest! Gajalaka Lockdown.\r\n- `Felyne Gajalaka Sword Alpha`\r\n- `Felyne Gajalaka Mask Alpha`\r\n- `Felyne Gajalaka Cloak Alpha`\r\n\r\n \r\n### Notes, Trivia, & Media\r\n- Just like with the rest of the `Grimalkyne tribes`, the `Lynian Researcher` provides you a bounty called `Cultural Exchange: Gajalaka Linguistics. ` (easy method for finding tracks: Start an expedition and pick a zone that the Lynian researcher is in. Locate him and search around him. There's usually around 3 to 4 close by. Then end expedition and repeat.) After completing the bounty, you can talk with the researcher again to engage another bounty: `Cultural Exchange: Gajalaka Linguistics II` which requires you to infiltrate in their camp at night time to befriends the Gajalakas. Succeeding to do so will allow you to use Gajalaka shortcuts in the `Elder's Recess`, unlock `Gastodon` and Gajalaka tailraiders (Latter ones are only available inside their base, accessible by a shortcut infront of the Gajalaka camp) and the Palico Gadget `Mewolotov Cocktail`.\r\n- Galajakas dwell in caverns throughout the land, and some will give help to hunters. This cooperation is the result of the Lynian Researcher's careful study.\r\n- They can attack by throwing bombs. In the New World, it is relatively easy to create explosives from natural materials, but one can recognize their keen intelligence and daring in this creation.\r\n- The Galajakas coat their weapons in various types of toxins. One depletes health, one induces Paralysis, and another induces Sleep. They are respectively purple, yellow and blue, and their masks are also covered to match.\r\n- Their rafts are made of earthenware and have beds of straw. The three feet on the rafts' underbellies are a unique trait. Pointing the feet in the direction of the raft's movement stabilizes travel on water. This is a simple but also extremely thoughtful design.\r\n- Galajakas have a unique culture, which includes this type of earthenware in addition to necklaces and certain religious views.\r\n- Galajakas operate in groups, threatening enemies and attacking in unison anyone who approaches.\r\n- Many hunters have nearly died due to the abnormal status effects of the Galajaka. But some skilled hands able to use the Galajaka against large monsters.\r\n- Gajalaka have a tailrider level. Upon reaching level 3 unity-wise, you can unlock the Gajalaka Shellshock. This works similar to the vine trap. Luring a monster to the waiting Gajalaka will cause a bomb squad to launch explosives at the monster.\r\n- The Galajaka wear a straw cape that covers part of their body and a large mask. The mask, which is made to look like a certain monster, is meant to indicate bravery, among other things.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"
